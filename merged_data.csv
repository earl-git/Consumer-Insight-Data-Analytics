R20IRE5X6WY351,B085296FLT,5.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones!,Talia Calazans,5,"I love these headphones, and I wear them all the time. They are pretty comfortable and also very cute. They are not too bulky. The noise cancelling is not great at cancelling voices, it really just cancels out background hums, which was a bit frustrating, but does well enough on things like planes. Other than that the sound is pretty good (as someone who does not care much about super high quality sound so I'm pleased with not bad). Battery is good, will last me a few days of pretty extensive use. Bought these on sale for $70 and it was increadibly worth it for this price.","Reviewed in the United States June 1, 2024",AG6TODKB7VQYDH7KJ2MKHF6RQEGA,TRUE,7,Color: Shadow GraySet: Studio3

R1UVTRVZ4F5DME,B085296FLT,5.0 out of 5 stars LONG battery life.,Julian,5,"I recently invested in the Beats Studio3 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones, and the experience has been nothing short of exceptional. These headphones effortlessly blend style, comfort, and cutting-edge technology, creating a remarkable auditory journey for music lovers and audiophiles alike.The standout feature of the Beats Studio3 is its impressive noise-canceling capability. The headphones effectively block out external sounds, providing an immersive and uninterrupted listening experience. Whether I'm in a noisy commute, a bustling café, or even on an airplane, the noise-canceling feature allows me to escape into my music without being disturbed by the outside world.Comfort is paramount during prolonged use, and the Beats Studio3 excels in this aspect. The over-ear design, combined with plush ear cushions, ensures a snug fit without causing discomfort or pressure. The headphones are lightweight, making them ideal for extended listening sessions without causing fatigue. The adjustable headband allows for a customized fit, ensuring a secure and comfortable feel.The sound quality of the Beats Studio3 is exceptional. The headphones deliver a robust and well-balanced audio experience, with crisp highs, rich mids, and powerful lows. The bass response, a signature of the Beats brand, adds depth to the music without overpowering other frequencies. Whether I'm listening to energetic beats or soothing melodies, the audio reproduction is consistently impressive.The integration of Apple's W1 chip enhances the overall user experience. The seamless pairing process with Apple devices is a breeze, and the Class 1 Bluetooth connectivity provides a stable and reliable connection. The efficiency of the W1 chip also contributes to an extended battery life, allowing for up to 22 hours of playback on a single charge.The on-ear controls add a layer of convenience to the user experience. Adjusting volume, skipping tracks, and managing calls can be done effortlessly with intuitive controls located on the ear cups. The incorporation of Siri support allows for hands-free control, adding an extra layer of functionality.The durability and build quality of the Beats Studio3 are commendable. The premium materials used in construction give the headphones a sleek and sophisticated look, while also ensuring resilience to everyday wear and tear. The foldable design and included carrying case enhance portability, making them a practical choice for on-the-go lifestyles.","Reviewed in the United States March 3, 2024",AHUVU5TLJQFQMZKFR7YKDB55USPA,TRUE,22,Color: Midnight BlackSet: Studio3

RFGOLBEISEB55,B085296FLT,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Headphones!,Leosha Williams,5,"These headphones are absolutely amazing! The volume, how they fit, the price, all top tier! I was stuck between these and the solo 3’s. I did my research and saw that the Solo 3’s can get uncomfortable after a while and that they don’t have noise cancellation. So I switched my focus onto the studios, and I'm glad that I did. The quality of these headphones is phenomenal! The bass sounds great. The headphones already drown outside noise out, but then when you cut the Actuve noise cancellation on, it’s like you’re in the world alone. I really couldn’t hear anything. Another plus is the fact that I have 21 days to add AppleCare+ to them. All of my products are protected with Applecare+ and this one will be as well. I definitely recommend these headphones if you’re looking for a great pair with noise cancellation and great studio sound! 10/10!","Reviewed in the United States June 1, 2024",AFBT2YGFVT6CBITOKGANUEJ5WYHA,TRUE,17,Color: Shadow GraySet: Studio3
R2AGD67A8P04AC,B085296FLT,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones, just don't fit my big ears.",Jacob,4,"Jan 2023 - First, I am not an audiophile. So, this review will not be super technical, just an average Joe who doesn't mind paying for quality products.I did quite a bit of research before buying my next set of headphones. I read tons of reviews on Amazon and the web. I read multiple ""review/ratings"" articles online that compared numerous headphones. Ultimately, I decided to buy these because I have an iPhone and AppleTV that they work seamlessly with, and they were always rated highly at their price point.I've used them for about 2 months now. They were simple to pair with my iPhone. When I am in my living room with my AppleTV on and I turn them on, my AppleTV asks me if I want to pair them, and they have done that easily every single time. I love this seamless functionality.I use them at work primarily. I work in office with 20+ cubes. I use them often simply for the noise-canceling to stay focused, and I use them just as often to listen to podcasts and music. When in noise-canceling mode, they do not remove 100% of every sound around you. No headphones can (that I am aware of). But, they do a great job creating a virtually noise free environment with a light ""white noise"" in the background (similar to a fan in the distance). You can turn noise-canceling off, and then the noises around you are simply muffled (if you're not actively playing something on the device you're connected to).As mentioned previously, I listen to podcasts, music, and watch TV and movies with these. I think they sound fantastic with all of these. Occasionally, they do sound just a tiny bit bass-heavy for some of the music I listen to or during movies with high-action scenes that have a lot of explosions, but that's just me I guess. Some people probably prefer that with the music/media they have.My one peeve is that they don't completely fit over my ears. The good news is the cushions on the earcups are super soft. So, I can still wear them comfortably... for hours. This doesn't seem to affect the noise-canceling at all.Lastly, they seem to have a really good battery life with my usage style. I use them for varying lengths of time. At work, it's not uncommon to get interrupted and need to turn them off after 5-10 mins because I need to step away from my desk, and sometimes I will have them on for 2+ hours. At home, I often use them at night to watch stuff on my AppleTV so that I don't take a chance of waking up my kids while they are sleeping, and I can get hours of watch time in without needing to charge them (as long as they weren't close to being dead already).If you can get them on sale (like I did: $170), I wouldn't hesitate to buy them, and I saw them on sale a lot (but the sale price varied quite a bit) leading up to my purchase. I don't even think their regular price is all that bad for what you get.","Reviewed in the United States January 23, 2023",AH3SC2BAKM6AA7XJMTJ4KAET6MSQ,TRUE,93,Color: Matte BlackSet: Studio3

There are a lot of different headphones you can buy, but as far as over the ear headphones these are great. Very light, get a little discomfort after long use, but not bad at all. Sound is great quality especially for the gym which is my main use for these. Just be sure to wash the ear pads if you do this.

R1H100TYFQZJLK,B085296FLT,2.0 out of 5 stars Please Read Before Buying.,O.Winnie Mittelberger,2,"My rating falls close to a 1.5 for multiple reasons:For starters, this headphone is marketed and sold as an ANC (Active Noise Cancelling), Over-Ear headphone. Typically, headphones like these are targeting people who buy them for travel (i.e. a plane ride) but also are helpful in any public space. Please keep this in mind for the rest of my comment. From the inside out, these headphones cannot hold their own with any other pair in the price range.I purchased my pair when they were 57% off, bringing the total from $350 to $160 (including tax), but I cannot in good conscious recommend them for either price bracket. Comparing them to the most common headphone in the $350 bracket, the Sony XM4 (and newly the XM5) are a essentially the opposite side of the spectrum when it comes to all qualities. They clearly lose the battle for acceptable headphones to buy for $350, but some could make a case for the discounted price.Everything I found wrong with the Beats (most to least important):- Sound quality is mediocre.I attribute this to the old design (nearing 3 years) and old parts (Apples W1 chip is long outclassed by the newest chips)With that said, I am also no audiophile (someone who has a keen skill/desire for high quality sound) but I can make general observations about the sound quality from the Studio3's. I can't give an super detailed review of the sound quality because I only listened to ~3 songs and maybe 2 videos. But I can say is the trope that ""Beats just overbass their headphones"" isn't true. I can't say what you find as a proper balance of bass, but to me it seemed fined and not too far one way or the other. But you can tell that the timbre wasn't all that it could be. For the MSRP listed, this should not be case, even for an old design that was adopted and revamped by Apple.- ANC, one of the primary marketing points, is horrible.This is comes from a variety of reasons other than just poor build quality, after reading into the making of the Studio 3's, Beats tried making an early ""adaptive"" ANC by changing the way sound is measured, processed, and then cancelled.However, it fails completely and everything from your fingertips rubbing together at arms length, to a pencil dropping behind a closed door is essentially the same with/without ANC on.The only different is bass is slightly toned down, you don't feel like constantly pressure that other ANC headphones give (kinda like you're in an airplane at max altitude), but you hear a slight ""woosh"" constantly.- As mentioned before, build quality as a whole is terrible.Straight out the box, the right earcup is crumpled a towards the bottom because of a poorly designed folding mechanism that squishes the earcup against the headband as it's packed into the case. The earcups themselves have this cheap, fake leather look and feel, the stitching is far apart and looks poorly made, the earcup foam is obviously cheap, it easily compresses (therefore there's a lot of air) but then refills as if the foam itself isn't compact but just large pockets of air (meaning the foam itself is low quality), and the size of the earcups is very small for over-the-ear headphones. So if you happen to be ok with everything I mention, having medium-big ears will already make the experience impossible to begin with.The top headband, a common weakpoint that's overlooked in headphone design, has literally no cushioning.They didn't even use the foam from the earcups, it's rubber on the outside (when slightly damp or if it just came off someone's head) feels comparable to a pencil eraser. There is a little give to the headband but the material underneath is too thin for me to discern from just pushing down.After wearing the headphones, straight from the box, you could start ""feeling"" the headband begin pressing into your head after ~1 hour, then feel that annoying soreness after ~1.5 hours of total listening. Once again, considering travel or just extended use would be expected of a $350 headphone, there were too many bad choice they let slide.With the buttons provided on the headphone, there is one good but a few bad things.Firstly, Beats Studio3 happen to be one of the few headphones in this bracket that have a distinct power button. But the action button and touch pad are the main concern I found.A lot of online reviews will say the action button (the beats logo) feels cheap and totally disrupts the hearing experience, but I can't say I completely agree. I do like a tactile button, but the button provided has a distinct and somewhat loud click. It doesn't inherently sound cheap nor satisfying to me, but that's partly subjective. However, you can hear the click very clearly when you are wearing them so if that's something you dislike, and you'd prefer a touchpad then be aware of that.One of my most concerning observations for the build was the Micro USB charger in the headphones. A lot of online reviewers bash on the cable that's provided to charge the Studio3 pair, but I don't mind that they were able to pack some ginormous cable because I can plug in the USB A into a nearby port for close charging. However, the choice for Micro USB charging as a whole is a bad idea to me. Micro USB is getting very old now, being outshined by Lighting and USB C when it comes to things like charging speed, data transfer speed, etc. But my main concern is durability. Again, a $350 pair of headphones should essentially guarantee you multiple years of use. I didn't fully test the battery life of the pair, but over my years of use with Micro USB I know that the cable itself can corrode but most importantly if the input port (like the one that built into the headphones) doesn't have good glue to hold it to the plastic inside of the earcup, then the port can pop out can render the charging useless. In the first example of the cable breaking with time, I'm sure a lot of people have old Micro USB cables laying around, but if the input port falls out, then you will be forced to use the provided AUX cord for the headphones (can't listen to portless devices like modern iPhones).- All the other complaints were at least somewhat merited regarding an expensive headphone. But this one is mostly based on aesthetic.Of these entirely subjective points, the most relatable would be the bulky carrying case the headphones come in. It's very wide and rounded, so it definitely won't sit in a backpack or carry-on without taking up unnecessary space. But if the case was designed to be wider/longer but slimmer (like the Sony XM4's) it could slide into thinner pockets without stretching out the bag. Also, forcing the headphones into a smaller but thicker case is what causes that earcup compression problem I mentioned earlier.The scale of the headphones looks off. From product pictures to models wearing them, the headphones look really nice and stylish. I bought the matte black pair, and I was excited to see how they looked. But they pair overall seems smaller than what you expected (like how I briefly mentioned the small earcups). The overall look seems like it could only give that proper ""Beats"" look on certain people with specific head sizes/shapes.If you happen to find this pair on sale, don't really care too much about noise cancelling, want a listening experience that is good but you don't mind if it isn't groundbreaking, but want a pair of headphones for more of the luxury aspect, then it wouldn't seem like a bad deal to buy these.","Reviewed in the United States December 29, 2022",AH46ZHN22ZKGHWOM3UMMORBATP2Q,TRUE,928,Color: Matte BlackSet: Studio3

This were on discount since they were going to release the next ones as well. I think the sound quality is excellent. The only things I would add are transparency mode and usb-c charging, which is exactly what they added on the new ones. Either way for the discount they had I think they are well worth the money.

R2GCZUGFSPN9GD,B085296FLT,4.0 out of 5 stars Decent if you get them on sale,Derek Shoff,4,"I’ll start by saying that these are not worth the retail price of $350. But they often go on sale for around $170 which Is where they need to be priced at for the quality of sound you get. I ordered the grey with gold trim because they were the only ones on sale when I was in the market, which I do love th my is color but I really wanted the red ones. Which are now also on sale for the same price as the grey one. Added that into this review just to let you know if there is a certain color you want just be patient they will go on sale. Now with all that said a big part of the reason I bought these was the noise cancellation feature which is a joke. I have a $50 pair of over the ear onns that do a way better job of noise canceling than these do.so if you are buying for that feature alone I strongly advise you to look elsewhere. The sound quality is decent. It does not compare to a good pair of Bose but you will be paying double for a pair of Bose. As long as you get these on sale for $170 or less I think you’ll be happy with the purchase. The bass is a little disappointing I really expected it to thump from Beats by Dre. It is there you can hear it but it’s not great. The fact that these are Apple compatible was a big reason I bought them I can pair them and talk effortlessly when I get a phone call without ever taking my phone out of my pocket. The microphone is by no means great but the caller should be able to understand you as long as you speak loudly and clearly. If the overall look is something important to you than I imagine that’s why your shopping beats in the first place because they definitely look better than all of their competitors headphones. I will end this review with another huge reason as to why I settled on them personally and maybe you will to. These are built for people with smaller heads. I really wanted a good pair of headphones to work out in, that would stay on my head nice and tight and I knew from the reviews I read before buying that these would do just that. I imagine they can get a little uncomfortable for people with bigger heads because they do sit tight but they are perfect for me.","Reviewed in the United States July 12, 2023",AE3XXREQ27I334BJK2CTMG4A6UNA,TRUE,56,Color: Shadow GraySet: Studio3

RNKST26GTRHD4,B085296FLT,"4.0 out of 5 stars Solid ANC heaphones, at the right price",Mike Jankowski,4,"Update 9/17/2022: After I wrote the review I found that on Android there are EQ apps that will help tune headphones to help them sound better. I personally use Wavelet now and with that these do sound really good now and clear up some of my criticisms about the sound in the original review. That being said, I can't find anything similar for iOS, so keep that in mind!I'll mention first that I didn't buy these headphones at full price, or anything close to it. At their original MSRP ($350) look elsewhere and don't look back, these get blown away by Sony and Bose and others at that price point. Once you get down to about $200 though? These start to look more tempting.I already have a pair of Audio Technica ATH-M50x's which have amazing sound, but no ANC, so they're great for around the house, but I needed a pair with ANC for work travel, so I took a chance on the Beats on a sale, and at a sale price, I'm pretty happy with them.The sound isn't bad, I know I've heard other people say there isn't a whole lot of bass. It does seem like that varies heavily from song to song, some give a nice, but never muddy, thump, others do feel a little lacking. Highs are pretty nice and crisp and come through well, it's the mids on these headphones that tend to be a bit muddled. It's by no means bad, but I'm also comparing it to some pretty good can headphones in roughly the same price range and the Audio Technica's win hands down there.ANC is probably the best feature of the headphones. It does a great job of keeping out engine noise when flying. Sony and Bose will do better at the Beats original price point, but at a sale price they do a very good job. You will run into a few weird quirks of it, for example I could hear it fighting the noise of a rough road while on a rental car shuttle which made for an interesting effect, but largely it just works and keeps out the noise well.Battery life seems to be pretty much what they're rated for, so no complaints there and the build quality seems solid. When using the controls, you will hear a clicking sound from the press, which I know some people have criticized. But, despite that, the controls are easy and intuitive. The look of them is pretty nice as well, but it would be nice if the ear cups to rotate to be flat on your chest, but that's a minor nitpick.Finally, the great irony, these actually seem to work better on my personal Pixel phone than my work iPhone, despite being an Apple product. The Android Beats app allows for better control of the headphones and the ANC, not to mention actually giving you a battery percentage as opposed to just a circle that gives you an approximate value. And with the Beats app installed, the pairing process was just as easy on my Pixel as it was for my work phone.Overall, they're solid headphones, but wait to catch them at the right price.","Reviewed in the United States August 4, 2022",AF7GBXJT26ZTDSSQHDYSLC6KFJ6Q,TRUE,126,Color: WhiteSet: Studio3

R10098H37FA770,B09XS7JWHH,5.0 out of 5 stars Are you Older? READ THIS.,Waydavis,5,"I am almost 65 years old SO, I DO NOT have the ears of a 18 year old. That said, I consider these to be good for these reasons:A: Exceptional battery life.B: Call quality that was considered good UNTIL I did a direct comparison to my Blueparrott B450-XT’s - NO WHERE NEAR the quality of the Blue 450’s, BUT the Blues are made specifically for calls in noisey environments. . Blues are in my opionion the defacto standard by which all other ANC phone calls should be judged. My ""demo"" for people is to run my upright vacuum cleaner whilst on a call. People on the other end cannot hear it AT ALL – REALLY!, I hear them, and they hear me perfectly! TRULY amazing! I did the same test with these and alas they failed miserably in comparison. I expected that. I was told they sound like I am in a room away from the microphone, a bit fishtank like, and muddy. SO, they’ll do in a call but not as a primary phone call device in noise. I heard a sample of the BOSE 700’s and they were terrible, which is what prompted me to get the Sony’s.C: One unconventional thing they do great at: A Sleep Aid. Yup, they drown out all the extraneous noises like people talking, Air conditioners, fans, Water coolers, hums, etc. ALL gone with nothing playing through them!I bought them primarily for playing on my PS5, and watching TV late at night. They do both quite well.D: Amazingly, my ears do not sweat much in these even after prolonged use. I’ve ordered those Dekoni Suede Earpads for them as well just for added comfort.(https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BS4T3X62?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)(5/16/23 - Returned The earpads: they claim they are suede when in fact they are 2/3 suede. The inner part inside the cup is something else, not leather so NOT durable. Considering this, $49 seems FAR too expensive.)E: They are long-term comfortable unless you have ears like a B-52 in which case you will probably be stuffing bits.As for music, I find them to be more flat without pronounced highs or bass - which I prefer. The EQ on the app is a nice feature. The ANC works very well listening to music and will be adequate to the task in both quiet and noisey settings. Again, I remind you, I’m not 18. ;-)Pricewise, they ARE a bit expensive but the build quality seems better than most.If you have the time, I would HIGHLY recommend you test several brands and models at a store simply because sound quality is subjective and EVERYONE has their preference.UPDATE: 5/23/23 - Returning (REPLACING) Headphones - Why? They started acting ""Funky"". By that, I mean that if you turn them off, they will not turn on unless you do not hit any buttons for about 15 sec. NOT normal. ALSO, they started to exhibit Connection issues that were NOT there initially. I STILL, at this point consider them excelllent. Now, if the NEW pair goes weird, THEN I would have to re-evaluate.UPDATE 6-3-23: New pair are working as they should no connection issues or on/off bttun problems.UPDATE 2-16-24: Still working perfectly and I use them nearly every night to sleep.","Reviewed in the United States May 4, 2023",AFXILNJYGCIM3OBH4UNBTQTZVR2A,TRUE,774,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
R381U8GJDBMZ3C,B09XS7JWHH,"5.0 out of 5 stars Good: sound, battery, storage",originalmike007,5,"These sound great both for music and phone calls. Phone call wise they’re at least on par with AirPod Pros, being reported by the other person in the call sometimes slightly better or worse.The battery lasts a surprisingly long time, seems to have a low self discharge rate, and charges quickly.While fairly comfortable and easily adjustable, I notice the thin band tends to create a bit of a pressure point during extended listening such as on an airplane. It’s best to move the band around occasionally.The case is nice and fits in my backpack well without any big bulges.They do seem a little fragile and find myself treating them gently, but really they have held up well so far.The app is mediocre, and sometimes doesn’t connect to the headphones. This can be annoying when I need to switch between devices such as my PC and my phone. However this could be an Apple thing, we all know how Apple doesn’t play well with third party devices.They’re not the easiest to use headphones and I wouldn’t recommend them for the technologically challenged. Notably the double tap doesn’t always register. Also there could be better differentiation for left and right other than just having the buttons on the left.","Reviewed in the United States July 20, 2024",AEXEJKL5NLHAWQDXD6VKERFF7Y6A,TRUE,3,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
R31L1M7XVZJ2HO,B09XS7JWHH,5.0 out of 5 stars Awesome Headphones,Melissa Follett,5,"What can I say, these headphones are amazing. The noise cancelling ability is incredible and they are definitely audiophile quality in the sound department. They come in a plain but nice protective case that includes a small 3.5 mm male to male jack and a type c to usb cable that is very short. The Sony Connect app really helps get the most out of these headphones. I just recently set up the 360 degree sound feature for these which really improves the sound experience on songs recorded with that feature. I also really like the equalizer included in the app. I use these headphones via Bluetooth from an iPhone 14 and the Amazon Unlimited HD app. Most songs sound fantastic and the volume is for the greater part sufficient. The majority of well sonically engineered songs are reproduced with stunning bass , smooth/detailed mids and extended highs. There are some songs that just are not produced as well and those can sound a bit anemic even with the bass on the eq maxed out. But this is a matter of the sonic quality of the source material and not the headphones themselves. I think the Bluetooth quality is exceptional and I can’t tell the difference between wireless and hardwired. I also plugged the headphones into my computer for testing and the volume went way higher then with my iPhone. It was actually louder than I could stand so these headphones can handle high volumes without noticeable distortion. I would not recommend listening at high volumes for extended periods of time if you value your hearing in the long term. I have not really activated or played around with the adaptive environmental features yet on the Sony app. Also, the phones mute when I talk and it pauses the source I am listening to. When I am done talking it resumes automatically. I am really happy with these headphones and feel they are a great value considering what they are capable of doing. I might also add that they are very lightweight and surprisingly comfortable to wear even for extended listening sessions. I had them on last night for 4 hours straight and although I knew they were on my head, they never felt uncomfortable or obtrusive. As a final note, I like their plain, unassuming look. I don’t need fancy looks, just give me top tier music reproduction and I am happy.","Reviewed in the United States March 2, 2023",AFIR77WLFKQIDZH6UNXBPMXPRUMA,TRUE,20,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
R1VV4EF5HN9FCB,B09XS7JWHH,5.0 out of 5 stars Love these!,Steve,5,"Okay I have to admit when I first saw these things in Best buy I thought they were the ugliest thing ever but honestly I think it was just the lighting there. They're actually some really nice looking headphones.Sound- these are absolutely incredible I'm hearing notes and backup singers and different nuances in music I didn't know existed and I've tried four or five different of the top line pairs including the JBLs, the boses, and the studio beats pro.These absolutey beat every other pair I tried and it wasn't even close. If I had to rate them in order these will be number one, The beats pro would come in at number two, The JBLs were number three and bose would be dead last.Comfort: I can wear these all day with no problem My ears will not be hurting the headphones themselves are very plush and comfortable and I have a smaller head in comparison to a lot of the headphones I've tried and the adjustment sizes are really great no matter what your head size is. The only downside is of how insulated I think the inner ear cuffs are because it will make your ear sweat after a while because it keeps your ears pretty toasty.And coming up on the number one reason why I bought these, these by far have the clearest sounding calls of all the headphones I've tried people on the other line can hear me clearly I can hear them clearly the Bluetooth syncs pretty effortlessly.Even the custom sound profiles that you can access during the app make it even better.The battery life is pretty good I can go pretty much 3 days 4 days without charging on one use I would have to say you probably can get a solid 24-30 hours runtime out of them.Literally the only thing that could be better on these is since they are made by Sony you would think they would hook up effortlessly to the PS5 and it does not which is really annoying considering it's the same company. You can still hook them up via audio jack into your controller and it works fine but I just think it's ridiculous that Sony will not let it be Bluetooth compatible to another Sony product like that.Overall even though it's pricey I think it's worth it and you're not going to do better than these headphones.Yes I actually own this product and I paid full price for them I am not a reviewer In fact I hardly ever come on here to review unless something's really great or something's really terrible.","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024",AF5LHVZTV4NPWELGHZFV6XC3C4KA,TRUE,23,Color: SilverSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
R2NGQ3HUPCW8EU,B09XS7JWHH,"4.0 out of 5 stars Not bad, but I expected a little better if I'm honest.",kcd,4,"I'm a hobbyist musician and sound engineer of 20 years and also mild audiophile that builds my own speakers. I like to think I know a little bit about sound and what it takes to reproduce sound, but the tricky thing with headphones is that everybody's' ears are different. Like, they're physically slightly different which makes every single person hear the exact same sound slightly different, but there's also our individual listening preferences too, so keep that in mind as you read this review. Personally, I prefer smooth, balanced, and LOW bass (down to 20Hz), but NOT boomy bass. I also like some sparkle in the highs (8k+).Initial impressions upon arrival and setup:- The packaging looks like it's a cheap recycled cardboard of some sort. Obviously doesn't affect the headphone's performance.- The zipable case the headphones live in also seem kinda cheap and flimsy. Again, it doesn't affect the headphone's performance.- Accessories are fairly light as it only comes with a stubby little 8"" long (seriously) USB charging cable (not even a wall adapter, just USB A to USB C) and a generic 1/8"" stereo headphone cable if you want to physically plug them into a headphone jack.- The app was easy to download, install, and update. It did require making a Sony account though, so points off for that.- Pairing the headphones to my phone and also my computer was quick and seamless. I did have to restart my computer to get Windows to send audio over the bluetooth connection, but that was an issue with Windows and not the headphones.- The headphones themselves feel of good quality and are super comfy for my average sized head.- The EQ you set in the app does persist when you connect to a different sound source. For example, the EQ curve I set on my phone was not active when I then paired the headphones to my laptop and listened to the same track.- Really needs more than 6 EQ points. Sony, you can do better than just 5 predefined sliders and a bass slider (basically 6 sliders, so IDK why the bass is separate from the rest).Listening impressions:- Best sounding headset I've purchased to date and sound MILES better than my Sennheiser HD 596 (but to be fair, those sounded ridiculously unnatural and just all-around terrible).- Plenty of ""thump"" by default, but definitely dropping off significantly below 50Hz or so, which is exactly what I like to have present in my mix. You can see I've put a HUGE boost in the low lows on my EQ curve to make things like low synths, bass drops, and sub-harmonics sound even with the rest of the sound stage. Even still, the sub-bass that is there still sounds a bit thin and artificial like they're using some processing trickery to make it sound like it's playing lower than it is (there are a few ways to do this, but they're never as authentic as just reproducing the frequency properly).- Little bit ""dark"" sounding, so a slight bump in the high mids as well as a 10k+ shelf bump really helped brighten up the sound stage.- Imaging is ok but definitely not spectacular. It's only got a single 30mm driver per ear, so that one driver is covering EVERYTHING from 20Hz to 40kHz. As such, it's expected that imaging won't be super detailed, so no surprise there. I was really hoping to see at least 2 drivers per ear. By contrast, my CCA C12 in-ear-monitors (IEM's) that I use when playing on stage are about $50 and have 6 drivers PER EAR each playing a different frequency range. Needless to say, the imaging, and extension on those IEM's is a LOT better than these headphones that cost 7x the price. Due to their small form factor, IEM's can use armature drivers where 'can' style headphones like this can't use armature drivers (not loud enough), but I would still like to see 2 dynamic drivers in these just to allow one driver to focus on the highs and the other to focus on the lows rather than having the one driver trying to play the whole shebang.- Minimal, but still present, ""pressure"" sensation when noise cancelling is on, but it's not intrusive like a lot of other ANC headphones I've tried and effectively disappears when music is playing. Having a set of ANC headphones with ""pressure"" that grabs my attention is an absolute deal-breaker for me regardless of price point.Overall, these are going to be my go-to headphone for the office. They sound good enough (especially with some EQ), and are comfy enough, to have some background music playing for hours at a time while also cancelling out loud office talkers.","Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2023",AGWUCS3NKCOOQFWGTSA3JKVOMBOA,TRUE,255,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
R36XGSDG52PX3E,B09XS7JWHH,5.0 out of 5 stars Sony never disappoints!,Richard Huynh,5,"I thoroughly enjoy what Sony has to offer in their product line. I have the PlayStation 5, a Sony Bravia 4K TV and several other Sony products. Yes although I have owned a few of their product line I will not try to be biased here with the review. What got me into Sony products was really their earphones dating back to 2011! They have the best earphones you could get for $20 back at the time in 2011 and now the quality they still continue to put out never disappoints! Here's the pros and cons of the Sony WH-1000XM5.Update: I also picked up the XM4 Earbuds from Sony and take note that those are on a different level for listening to music compared to the XM5 Over the Ear headphones. Shares the same features like the XM5, not the same sound like over the ear obviously but also more marketed to those who goes to the gym and likes something more compact.Pros:Comfortable and lightweight!I don't ever have a complaint with what they have to offer when it comes to comfort. These are better than BOSE in regards as to comfort. I think the one thing that makes them comfortable also is that they are light. They weigh only about 0.56 pounds! People tend to have problems with headphones if they are heavy in my opinion! I also assume they use a low density memory foam for cushioning which is great but will eventually need to be replaced or tended to if left compressed or squished for too long.Unique featuresNoise Cancelling is top notch but not much different than their previous lines in my opinion! It is a standard these days to get noise cancelling and the headphones are great for drowning out noise if need be. They also tend to those who need to be aware of their surroundings by implementing a ambient mode like previous models. Works great and works like a charm by either taking the headphones off or covering the touch control panel. Also the Speak to Pause Music feature is insanely nice to have! Helps when your hands are busy and or you just don't want to adjust your headphones having to speak.Superb sound!The sound quality out of these are amazing! Does really well in all areas of music genres. Particularly really in low frequencies for bass! I get to enjoy these at a great volume and it pairs amazingly with my PS5 as a gaming headset! (Will mention the headphones does not come with a microphone for gaming when using a headphone jack.) As a pair of noise cancelling headphones, you can expect to hear a positively good detail in music, movies, gaming or even a phone call! They are clear and surprisingly really balanced. The microphone on these headphones for phone calls are great. Better than the previous versions.Fast charging!The charging rate of these headphones is incredible! I never knew how fast charging can be with this! There's times I have left this powered on overnight as I'm at work for my 10 hour job and it was drained by the time I wanted to use it again. In those times I left it charging and goodness greatness these were ready to go in a about 10-15 minutes! I enjoy these so much that I'm actually glad they have a 24-30 hour battery life.Cons:Cost.Its expensive! If you can get these on sale, it's worthwhile! If it's in your budget go for it! You pay for what you get in my opinion and these are worth their weight in gold!Fitment.They don't exactly fit around my short wide neck whenever I need to take it off and be present in a conversation or in my surroundings. Not exactly a big matter or deal breaker. More so it's a personal perspective. My neck size is 15 ¾ inches in circumference and that's pretty average I believe. I have to extend these in order to keep them around my neck without compromise. They also do not fold inward like the previous Sony headphone models but again never a issue.Cushion. Yes the ear cup cushions are comfortable but again when I place them around my neck it compresses the cushion to a point where it feels awkward after putting it back on. I'm looking at other options to replace their soft fit leather design.Update: There is different earcups that you can replace the OEM cups with but it comes at a cost of I believe $60 which is worth noting.Conclusion.Worthiness of $350+ (price as of 12/07/2022) during the holidays? Yes!Personal opinionated review:Sony WH-1000XM5 or other leading competition? Sony, easily Sony. I've never been unhappy about this purchase and I tell people that Sony is industrial leading company that continues to impress people when it comes to their headphones. Beats by Dre(Apple), Apple and Bose has always been great by popularity but Sony gets appraised by quality!I will update this review as I go until they put a new model out.","Reviewed in the United States November 24, 2022",AG4AFQ2RC6MGWY2PL7QUCONDWZOA,TRUE,221,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
RNC03UI3GJONP,B09XS7JWHH,5.0 out of 5 stars Like wearing technology,Chicken Little,5,"I bought the Bowers and Wilkins Px7 S2 a couple of years ago, refurbished like new. Its sound is excellent, and its soundstage is good as they claim. However, its microphone was not as good as I had hoped.Fast-forward to 2024, the Sony WH1000MX7 was on sale for nearly 50% off the original MSRP. Of all of the Bluetooth headphones with ANC, it was consistently rated the best or runner-up. Notably, its microphone was well-regarded.I bought one, refurbished like new.I will compare these two as they were contemporaries and direct competitors.My general use cases consist of listening to music while I work, participating in a virtual meeting, and talking on the phone while I do chores around the home.Music on the Bowers and Wilkins is where the headphones shine. The Px7 S2 was reported to have a very neutral sound out of the box. I found that to be very true. Its soundstage magic and clarity of drivers gave each part of the music very good separation.I listened to the Jurassic Park theme song from years ago — don’t judge. It is orchestral with many instruments contributing to the detailed delight of sound. I use this track to sound-check every new pair of headphones I get, so this would have been the sixth or seventh pair of headphones I used to listen to that theme song. For the first time, I heard two or three instruments whereas before I thought there was only one.How did the Sony’s do? They were pristine headphones, but they couldn’t achieve that level of detail and separation.Out of the box, the Sony headphones are said to be a bit bass-heavy. However, the customization feature of the app allowed me to tune the bass to my preferences.Sony partially compensates with its app and five-channel equalizer, but it could not better B&W’s music-playing prowess.For the second challenge, the Px7 S2’s were wasted on video conferencing calls. Yes, my managers never sounded so life-like except when they were in person. My tuned Sony cans were more than capable of reproducing their sound. Sony wins this round, because my colleagues described me as sounding more loud with my Sony’s.And in the final challenge, I switched between the two headphones while taking telephone calls. For the most part, the Px7 S2’s was overqualified in sound production. Background sounds on my end were also filtered out by the mic, except on two occasions when I got ice from my ice dispenser and ripped open a package at chest height. Meanwhile, the Sony sounded just fine, but the ice dispenser was not so annoying at the other end.Other notes:The Px7 S2 has a physical button to toggle on-off. It’s a quick flip of the switch, and within seconds it is connected and ready to go.The Sony’s power button is a press-and-hold button. It’s a little more annoying, because if you hold it too long, it does something else. It takes just as long to get connected.Gone are the days I tell my conversation partner to wait while I get bluetooth connected and have to put on elevator music for them.Of the two designs, I prefer Bowers and Wilkins’s.The Sony headphones rely mostly on touch controls. Although all manner of functions can be done via touch, I can’t remember which gesture does what. The Px7 S2 uses physical buttons for volume control, play/pause, and connect and disconnect. Once more, I prefer the physical controls.Finally, the B&W headphones are noticeably heavier than the Sony ones. If you’re sitting and staying still, the extra weight doesn’t matter. On the other hand, if you’re up and about and turning your head often, the Sony’s feel much more planted on the head. The Sony’s are generally regarded as having better ANC. In my experience around the house, they’re very close. It still surprises me which sounds get through ANC and which don’t. With enough happening around you, the Sony’s seem to block more sound.You can’t go wrong with either pair of headphones. It’s very much up to your preferences. If you like strawberry — I don’t know — go with one of them. If you prefer chocolate, then go with the other one, I’d say.Ok fine. If you want a more feature-filled app or better EQ or better mic or lighter weight => Sony.Sound or materials and style => B&W.How about that?","Reviewed in the United States August 7, 2024",AGZUC2JLX2SMXCWLL2R2ZXJAEAMQ,TRUE,0,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
R22JP1IN84JKFS,B09XS7JWHH,3.0 out of 5 stars Volume Controls Are Very Problematic,Bill Doerr,3,"I bought this in late 2023 as he Sony brand has always held a bit of panache for me (and, others). So it was a no-brainer.Prior to buying these headphones, I had used and loved my Jabra headphones which I still use and still love. Sadly, while the Jabra's sound and ease-of-use was superb, the ear cushions did brcke down too"" And so I through, ""WTH . . . let's see what the Sony headphones are like.""What these do very well: 1. Sound quality I'm sure there are better headphones out there, but these are pretty danged good quality 2. Comfort Sony did well here. I use them for making / taking calls and I can leave them on all day without a problem. 3. Battery Life Again, these last me a whole day -- making and taking calls and listening to music, radios and TVWhat these do NOT do well: 1. External controls Simply unacceptable when you need to change the volume from the headphones quickly and easily. I own a different brand of headphones (Jabra) that uses a 'mechanical' button to easily adjust volume -- the Sony headphones require running your finger/s over the headphone's surface to make changes. This functionality rarely works. And, when you need to adjust the volume, it's extremely frustrating to do so using the headphones. 2. Noise Cancelation Again, a key frustration for me. When I use it, a different tone follows each setting. My Jabra uses actual voices vs. tones. For example, my Jabra says, ""Noise-cancelation OFF"" -- the Sony just emits a tone/ And, because the directions are so bad, you can't find out what each tone suggests. Also, the N/C functionality it far less effective at killing ambient noise than I find I get from my other headphones. 3. Software Sony's software is far more complex than is actually needed to what it's designed to do -- LISTEN to good music, take calls, etc. Even though Sony's manual allegedly explains how to use the software, due to its complexity of it, most won't use nearly half of what it could do for you. Again, a missed opportunity here, as well.QUESTION: I'm often asked, ""Would I buy the Sony over the Jabra if I had to buy another set?"" Candidly, ""No, I wouldn't. Why do you ask?"" Both are good brands and the sound quality and ability to take / make calls are good (Though Jabra is better). But the horrific (IMHO) volume controls the Sony has as well as the noise-cancellation argue Sony made something good . .. good and complex. Still, the SONY headphones are good but they still need to refining them so they work as you'd expect.","Reviewed in the United States July 28, 2024",AF5RNDUYL3MDYR7SFLIJH6MDOLDQ,TRUE,4,Color: Midnight BlueSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
R1Z5IQRHE12YL4,B09XS7JWHH,"5.0 out of 5 stars UNBELIEVABLE carbon fiber sound quality, improved ANC with 2 processors and 8 improved mics",Fresh and Felicia,5,"The media could not be loaded. I own Sony’s WH-1000 XM4s and the Bose 700s, two of the leading models in the industry. I had AirPods Max for a minute, but I rage-sold them. To me, the Sony and Bose are both awesome headsets. So I was psyched to hear Sony was releasing XM5s. Summer’s here, and these can get a little hot on hot days outdoors. It’s like wearing earmuffs on the beach. But, if you can get past a little sweaty ears, or if you use them indoors or on airplanes, you should be a little excited.The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones feature, what Sony advertises, “industry-leading noise cancellation.” And they ain’t lyin. With Bluetooth 5.2 and Sony's QN1 and V1 chips, the XM5s have DUAL processors - compared to the lonely single processor of the XM4. These two processors control 8 microphones for crazy accurate noise cancellation. Think - a little computer actually sampling noise from fans, airplane engines, air conditioners, motors, and consistent noise like that - and creates an identical but perfect opposite wave, so they kinda cancel each other out. And this time, the dual processors are capable of filtering higher frequency sounds, including some voices. It’s pretty cool tech. The first time you hear this, it’s like magic! In my video review, you can see my personal reaction.With the XM5s, noise canceling is automatically optimized based on your wearing conditions and environment. You don’t have to do anything. It knows if you’re sitting, walking, in an airplane, et cetera.No, noise reduction probably won’t completely cancel a very loud angry spouse, or a crying baby. But the over the ear closed design may help dull annoying sounds.A very small cadre of people claim they become nauseous using noise cancelling headphones, and especially the old model XM4s. I’ve never experienced this personally, but be aware it could happen. You can disable it if you need to. Some people thought the WH-1000XM4s were too snug. I thought they felt great, but they’ve improved the fit with a new lightweight design with soft-fit leather. This material fits snugly but with less pressure on your ears while still keeping out the external sounds you don’t want to hear.There were a few other design changes – the XM5s aren’t foldable like the XM4s, and there’s a redesigned case that’s collapsible to save room in your bag when you’re wearing your headphones.With up to 30 hours of battery life, you’ll have enough power to travel halfway to the moon in one of Elon Musk’s rockets. But, in case you forgot to charge and you’re in a hurry, you can get 3 hours' worth of charge after just 3 minutes with an optional AC adapter.And unfortunately, the in-flight plug adapter is not included in the supplied accessories this time. But who uses that anyway? That’s so old school! Fortunately, there still is an aux-in for you old-school holdouts.The touch controls survived, where you can pause/play/skip tracks, control volume, activate your voice assistant, and answer phone calls. And the speak to chat lives also, where as soon as you start a conversation, Speak-to-Chat automatically stops your music and lets in ambient sound. And wear detection knows when you take them off.But – how do they sound?Sony has popped new, more rigid, 30mm carbon fiber drivers in the XM5s. They have more of an audiophile sound profile with slightly more balanced sound, better clarity, and more accurate bass. That’s important if you listen to real music, you know, with actual instruments, like rock, jazz, r and b, country, classical, and music like that. The XM4s have 40mm drivers, which will probably be better for hip-hop. The XM5s will reproduce hip-hop very accurately, meaning the way the studio producer intended you to hear it, but they probably won’t have the head-vibrating tinnitus-inducing bass many people want. TBH that's hard to find in any headphone due to physics.The XM5s support LDAC and spatial 3D audio, whatever that is, and they have also upgraded their Sony Music Studios Edge-AI music algorithm, which somehow magically guesses what musical dynamics were lost during compression and tries to replace that, so everything sounds crisp and clean without losing the bass that’s necessary in most of today’s popular music.I have heard some folks claimed the MX4s sounded “muddy” with some music. I didn’t notice that, but I’m a producer and I’m familiar with equalization. There are about 20 presets including several you can create yourself.And even without the Qualcomm APTX Low Latency chip, both my XM4s and XM5s allowed me to watch a complete movie on Netflix on my 2022 Samsung Frame television, wirelessly, from 10-plus feet away, with ZERO loss in mouth synchronization. Plus, like my XM4s, the XM5s still have dual Bluetooth pairing so you can pair them with two devices at the same time and switch back and forth between them. It's a pretty cool feature if you use them for your phone, but also want to use them to watch YouTube videos at work on your computer. But, you probably shouldn’t tell your boss about that.And the XM5s work with Google Assist, Alexa, and Siri. You can even set up Spotify playback with a few taps. Try that on your Air Pods Max.The big win seems to be a vast improvement in the sound of your voice during phone calls quality. They’re actually impressive when it comes to calling in louder rooms. I’ve made test calls on busy streets and on windy sidewalks, and my call-ee said she couldn’t tell I was actually outdoors. Apparently, the four beam-forming microphones and the dual-processor software can recognize your voice and somehow block a lot of background noise. I mean, you can still probably hear tire screeches, gunshots, and car alarms, things you’ll typically hear in the city. But a lot of the noise is just gone. Like magic!Oh – and there’s Speak to Chat. You start speaking, and the XM5s automatically adjust noise cancellation to pick up the voices of other people. No buttons, no fumbling with your phone. That’s a pretty cool feature.So are they worth the upgrade? If you have XM4s and you think your call quality is shaky, then grab some XM5s and sell your sweaty old XM4s on Craigslist. If you’re moving from Bose's Noise Canceling 700 or QuietComfort 45s, the new dual processors and 8 microphone array will provide some noticeable improvements, plus the dual Bluetooth sync, so they’re probably worth looking into. If you’re done with your Air Pods Max and prefer better compatibility with non-Apple stuff including android phones, PCs, and Sony or Samsung Smart TVs, it’s a no-brainer.","Reviewed in the United States May 24, 2022",AFWWNMFZLULQLTUU7IM6PHHRLEFA,TRUE,1394,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
R21NMC3L9AHPU2,B09XS7JWHH,"5.0 out of 5 stars Improvement over the Sony XM4 with ANC and sound quality. ""OK"" for office use (read)",W. Kwok,5,"I was hesitant about purchasing these because I was mostly satisfied with my Sony XM4 headset but was looking for an upgrade/replacement because the XM4s just get buggy with resuming my music sometimes when I put my hand over the earset or accidentally speak while listening to my music. I also was using the XM4 at work in a noisy environment where web conference participants would complain about the background noise from its mic.I purchased the XM5 to replace the XM4 at work primarily to address the noisy background complaints. The ANC on the XM5 was noticeably superior to the XM4. In online meetings, the same people who complained about the background noise when I spoke remarked that they could hear my voice much better with my new (XM5) headset. However, if I didn't speak and there was some loud noise, they would still hear it, but it was welcome feedback that when I did speak, the microphone minimized the background noise and my voice carried over better in my meetings. Since this was my personal consumer headset, my company eventually went to a commercial solution and got the EPOS 5000 series headsets, which have far superior directional microphones that put the Sony XM5 mic to shame. Hopefully, that bit of information is helpful if you are challenged by noisy environments like a call center where you're next to another person.Back to my XM5 review. I'm giving these a 5 star rating because for a consumer-level product, they are well worth the price I got them for(about 300 on sale). I used them on a flight and was in pure bliss being able to focus on my movie and music without having to compete with the airplane engine drone. For bluetooth headphones, they sound pretty good, but will never exceed a quality set of wired cans that cost more. You can adjust the EQ settings to make the Sonys sound better. I have since gifted this headset to my wife, who loved the ANC and how much clearer it made for her to be able to listen to hear tunes or watch movies. I'm looking forward to Sony's next iteration of the XM series headset. I got excited when the ULT model was released, but that's just a middle range model that still won't surpass the quality and performance of the XM5s. The battery life on the XM5 really does last about 30 hours too, so you'll easily get one to two days of full use on one charge. Below is a summary of some things I really liked and/or disliked about the XM5:PROS+Portable zipper carrying case included with accessories (3.5mm gold plated headphone cable, USB C charge cord)+quick pairing+adjustable EQ+rivals or beats other similarly priced ANC BT headsets (Bose, Sennheiser, Apple)+normal phone calls sound great+30 hour battery life+quick charging (3 hours after 3 minutes charging with special optional AC adapter)+Alexa and OK Google compatible+touch controls on the headset+improved sound quality over XM4+design seems more durable than XM4+instant pause and replay when taking headphones off and putting them back on+Amazing ANC (automatic noise cancellation) that you can turn on or off with a switch+collapsible design where headphone earcups fold flatCONS-Bluetooth 5.2 is starting to age since 5.4 improvements are available in other headsets-Not as compact when ""folded"" as the XM4s were-Just adequate for noisy environments (get a commercial headset for call center level noise)-Not water resistant, so avoid the rain or sweaty workouts-Incremental upgrade over XM4, even though it's noticeable-Two prong airplane adapter is omitted from the packaging (they're included in the XM4 packaging)","Reviewed in the United States July 7, 2024",AE57LA6R33NROCKCODXW5Y5ABQPA,TRUE,12,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
R3BL71F43SO0A3,B09XS7JWHH,5.0 out of 5 stars These are awesome for ears that stick out,dacia hutson,5,"I was doing research to see if any manufacturers made nice headphones for those whose ears stick out. What happens is after an hour of wearing regular headphones (not 80s/90s style), the extra cartilage in the back starts to hurt a lot and you need to take a break from the headphones.Well, the Sony headphones are the most I’ve ever paid. I avoided buying Beats for that reason in the past. However, when I saw the shape of the Sony and the positive reviews related to my predicament, I just went for it.I’m so glad I did. First, the expensive price offers so much than I would have imagined. You have to download the Sony headphones app to link these to your device. Once you do,There are many options for sound effects, for noise canceling, ambience, turning off automatically if the phones are removed, pausing if you start talking, etc.THE NOISE CANCELLATION CHANGED MY QUALITY OF LIFE. I live in a thin walled, thin ceiling condo apartment neighborhood. I can sleep with these ALL night without pressure on my ears, and beautiful white noise with the outer world noises 90% gone. Wow. I’m so glad these exist. Oh, not only that, but they last up to 18 hours. My AirPods die within 4 hours and would come off at night.The comfort, sound quality, battery life and life change makes these 100% worth it.

R2A3D0VE6ED8KF,B09XS7JWHH,4.0 out of 5 stars Noise canceling ✔️ Phone calls 👎🏻,Esums,4,"I'm autistic and the sound of lawn mowers make me want to die casually. Summertime is the worst. I have no idea why everyone on the planet is obsessed with mowing their lawn. I digress. I needed the top noise canceling headphones after they were casually mowing 4 days a week at my office. I kid you not. I can't handle it. These are phenomenal for canceling sound. My neighbor also blasts terrible music outside and these totally block that. However, for nearly 500 bucks, people should be able to hear me in a call. I can't yell in office and I shouldn't need to. I have sony noise ones and the call quality is significantly better. I appreciate how great these are for noise, but also dude they should be great in every category for the price imo. They charge very quickly and on the same charger as my phone, which I love. Usb c. Still, rather disappointing.. I also feel like the buttons are not super easy to understand. I.e. I didn't read those more than once and now I have to go back and read them. I will say one feature I like is that if I take off my headphones, it auto pauses my audio and will restart it when I put it back on. I wear headphones minimum 40 - 50 hours a week. 🤷🏻‍♀️","Reviewed in the United States August 6, 2024",AFVU37FRYFJQ7AJ4ZMRFZGGG5ILQ,TRUE,0,Color: SilverSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
R1P3AXUG7YP4RA,B09XS7JWHH,4.0 out of 5 stars Headaches after 1 hour of use but sound quality and connectivity were a win,nin,4,"I gave these a try as my primary work headset, with my key priorities being comfort and connectivity. Sound quality was important, but not a deciding factor. These checked most of the boxes; they sounded great and had the a very stable connection (0 issues during my trial of this set), but the comfort for some reason wasn't there.For the price, I was hoping I could wear this headset for 5-6 hours without issue during my work day, but they fell far short. I don't know why, but after 1 hour of use I consistently had a headache. I tried for several days over several calls and had the same result without any indiciation that it would improve, and since the goal of these was work calls over Teams and Zoom, I could not keep them.There are definite pros to this set though and I'm sure it's a me thing as far as why I was getting headaches (tons of reviews dispute my personal findings). The audio quality over BT was exceptional. I found it odd that it wouldn't work over USB-C while it charged, but maybe that's not an industry standard thing (my last headset did this so I got used to it). The connectivity was incredible; no issues with dropping during calls and very fast reconnecting. Handled multiple devices flawlessly. The app was nice. Overall I liked it but could not justify keeping it at this price when I couldn't wear it more than 1 hour.","Reviewed in the United States July 22, 2024",AF7PDLMEJIQEYUD4BSNYE774ZS6Q,TRUE,0,Color: Midnight BlueSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
R20CYL54OHFDCZ,B09XS7JWHH,5.0 out of 5 stars Can Hear Any Noise You Want,Tian,5,"After two years using the headphone, here is my review and thoughts.Pros:The WH-1000XM5 has very good battery life. I'm never anxious about even after two years.Sounds quality are pretty good than the WH-1000XM4. Usually the Noise Canceling has the sound quality issue. The sound is like listen music under water. But the WH-1000MX5 is not.Cons:Terrible Noise Canceling. The headphone has ANC (auto-noise-canceling) feature which automatically adjust noise canceling based on environment noise. It sounds like a cool feature but the reality is when the noise is not loud enough, the headphone will not work hard to cancel the noise. It only works based on what it think NC is enough for you, not your feeling. As a result you can hear almost all the noises from environment. People talking, AC, car from the street, even the fan in the bathroom. The noise canceling effect just like put some toilet paper in your ear.How about turn off the ANC and user adjust the canceling by themselves?You can do it in older version of WH-1000 series but not for MX5. It has been two years and tons of people complain about it in all the forums but SONY still choose to ignore it.So currently, the best way to use WH-1000XM5 is with a 33dB NRR soft earplugs.","Reviewed in the United States July 17, 2024",AE4GEDINUOUMYC3VZQEG6CCXJX2A,TRUE,1,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

When I take the headphones with me while running errands, I'll keep them on my neck or strung onto my belt bag/purse. The Sony headphones' connectivity are not as seamless as I'd assume AirPod Maxes would be with Apple products. Sometimes the Sonys don't immediately pair with my iPhone and I have to go into settings to pair. But, these headphones are a much better value than the Apple AirPods Maxes so I'm willing to overlook that minor inconvenience. Overall, I love them.

RM1Q7FEWXKB10,B09XS7JWHH,4.0 out of 5 stars Review After 2 Months,Andrew,4,"Quick take aways:Without an EQ, the headphones have a very very dark sound signature (I was not a fan)Sound very good for Bluetooth headphones with EQ, sound okay when wiredANC seems to be decent, lot of customisability in the appANC works well in standalone mode (without pairing)Battery life is goodNo form of sweat/water resistance is a minus but can be worked aroundHigh noise floor (if you care about that sort of thing)Optional pause with take off and resume with put on feature is amazing!As a preface, the Sony WH-1000XM5 are my first set of ANC headphones. I would consider myself a mild audiophile (I have a DAC, AMP, and too many headphones). With that said, everyone's ears are different so take this with an extra pinch of salt.Out of the box experience: The packaging was quite nice. It included a hard-shell carrying case, USB-C to USB-A charging cable, 1.2m long 3.5mm cable, and the headphones. The connection process for new devices is wonky and leaves a bit to be desired. The initial pairing did not work until I installed the Sony Headphones Connect app from the appstore. After this, you have to power off the device then power on and hold the power button for 5 seconds to enter pairing mode (confirmed by a vocal ""pairing"" from the headphones). The sound signature left a lot to be desired. For a bit of background, my favourite type of headphone is flat/neutral with a balanced sound signature. I enjoy heavy bass in electronic music and am sensitive to loud highs/mids (I get listener fatigue quite fast from it). I enjoy a lot of variety when listening to music an will try most things out. In particular I regularly listen to Classical, Avant-garde, Experimental, Easy listening, Electronic, Contemporary folk, Latin, Jazz, Rock, and some Traditional folk. I don't tend to listen to much Blues, Rap, or Hip Hop. I occasionally listen to mainstream-Pop and Country.Without EQ, the sound signature is very very dark. The bass is very punchy and present, the mids are recessed, and the highs have their edge taken off. I was not a fan of it for anything but electronic tracks with no vocals and heavy bass. Even then, it wasn't particularly amazing. Anything with vocals will sound horrendous (again, with no EQ) as the bass frequencies in voices will be very pronounced. The ANC worked well for me out of the box. For the open mode, I set it to let near voices through and ambient noise out. I use them with eyeglasses but the ANC still seems to work well. They do a particularly good job of filtering out A/C noises, the electronic whine that appliances generate (not all people can hear this), and running water. The ANC tends to struggle with erratic high pitched noises (as I understand it, most ANC systems do). However, it will dull the noise a tad through both the closed back headphone and ANC component.Adaptations Since I was not a fan of the sound profile out of the box, I set up an EQ profile with these headphones. The Sony Headphones Connect app includes an EQ but I found it to be extremely limited in terms of customisability (I did not like any of the presets that were offered) and not very user friendly. Due to this, I set up my own external EQ using AutoEq (on github) as a starting point. After fine tuning it to my preferences, using the headphones became a much much better experience. They sound very good for Bluetooth headphones. For genres where I like more bass, I strongly prefer the Sony headphones over my Sennheiser and prefer the Sony to my Bose. In wired mode, the headphones definitely sound better but no where near as good as my other wired headphones. If I'm attached to a wire, I would rather just switch to another pair of headphones. With that said, they do sound better if you leave the headphones on while connected with a cable. The ANC works well for me. If I use them for noise canceling without music, it can get unsettlingly quiet in the mornings (which is a great thing). Around others, particularly in the kitchen, the headphones do a very good job of dulling and eliminating noises. The pass through function works well in the event of conversation. I am a very quiet eater but these headphones did a great job canceling out all noises while I ate. I don't use these headphones outside, so I do not know how well they perform with nature's noises. The gesture controls included are useful but a bit too involved to be my go to. If I have physical access to my device, I prefer to use that to control the music. However, the pause on take off feature is amazing! It consistently pauses my media any time I have to take my headphones off and resumes right where it left off and soon as I put it on. Simply magic is the only way I have to explain it (the function can be turned off if you don't like/want it).","Reviewed in the United States March 26, 2023",AE5DD5GYEJZMSBJWNIOSVPJ7VSUA,TRUE,132,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

However, durability remains a concern, so handle with care. Comfort: 3.2/5Comfort was the biggest issue for me. My sensitive ears heat up quickly, and the pressure/fit, combined with the cup material, doesn't allow my ears to breathe. Consequently, it becomes uncomfortable to wear these for long periods.

R3IO6AFXH4Q3QQ,B09XS7JWHH,5.0 out of 5 stars I love these headphones so much I returned my Senheisers for them,Tyler,5,"I initially bought the Senheiser momentum 4 when I was looking for a new pair of headphones. When I put them on, I was wildly disappointed because they didn't even compare to my old Sony 1000-XM3. When comparing those two I realized the XM3 had significantly better noise canceling, so I figured I should upgrade to the 1000-XM5. It is definitely an upgrade to the old pair. The sound quality is slightly improved but overall very good sound quality to the point where you start to dislike hearing music playing from other speakers or headphones. The noise canceling is top notch when combined with the sound of music or a movie playing. It makes the sound of the engines on a plane almost disappear, and any kind of ambient noise that you would hear in day to day is completely gone. Again this is also an improvement to previous models. Another great feature that is added is automatically powering off when it senses that they are taken off. This can significantly increase the amount of time you can go before having to charge again because older models would only automatically power off when the Bluetooth disconnected. In that case it wasn't really helpful for when you're wearing them to sleep.","Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2024",AH6G5XVJDUGNPG7KDDAPF736ID3Q,TRUE,1,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
R1QDJ6PZICT8D2,B09XS7JWHH,2.0 out of 5 stars These had so much potential...,GarthVader,2,"There's A LOT to love about the Sony WH-1000XM5. I really wanted to write a rave review on them. Unfortunately I've also had a series of horrible problems that make them impossible to recommend.I'll start with the good. 1) These have the best ANC (active noise cancellation) on the consumer market right now. I also have Airpods Max and have compared with a freind's top of the line Bose QC Ultra. These put both to shame when it comes to ANC. It's incredible. Like so good it's almost dangerous.... I kinda worry I wouldn't hear a fire alarm going off while listening to music with these lol. I should note though, that to get this ANC performance you have to make sure there's nothing between the earpads and your head, like a hat or bunched up hair. My metal framed glasses don't make a difference, but my chunkier plastic frames let a bit more noise through 2) The battery life is amazing. I've been getting 24-28 hours of use with ANC on for each charge. They also charge fast - for me it's typically 45 minutes to go from zero to fully charged. For fast charging you do need a quality USB-C cable (I use Anker cables - they're excellent and very affordable). When I used a cheap crappy cable it took over 2 hours. 3) They're incredibly light-weight and very comfortable. I almost forget I'm wearing them. The ergonomics make them feel like they're custom made for my head and the ear pads and head band are the softest I've ever felt on headphones. The build is pretty plasticky, but they still feel well made / durable... and I think it's worth it for the weight reduction it allows. 4) Like any Bluetooth noise canceling headphones you're not getting hi-fi audio quality, but its better than most other bluetooth headphones. It's not as good as Airpods Max, but better than Bose and any of the cheaper bluetooth headphones I've tried. The most notable weakness is some muddiness in the lower frequencies, in my experience. 5) The case it comes with is awesome. It's a bit bulky, but it keeps the headphones very well protected and has a small compartment that you can keep a charging cable or 3.5mm audio cable in (which you can use for a wired connection if the battery dies, if the device you're using has a headphone jack). It's also very nice aesthetically. Overall the case puts Apple's Airpods Max case to absolute shame - that one barely covers half of the headphones, so it's worthless for protection. I'd honestly throw it away, but Apple is a dick and decided to make it so the headphones are always on and using battery unless you put them in their crappy case. 6) If you download the mobile app, there are tons of options to customize your experience. You can change the EQ, turn speak-to-chat on/off (disables ANC when it detects you're speaking to someone), choose your priority between sound quality vs. stable bluetooth connection, allow to connect to 2 devices simultaneously, integrate Siri or Amazon Alexa, customize controls, and a bunch of other things.Okay, now the problems. 1) A week after I bought them the speaker in the right ear started randomly making a loud buzzing/popping noise periodically. It's not all the time, but pretty frequent and very annoying. It happens for about 30 seconds a few times every hour of use. Sony claims it happens in places where ultrasonic waves are used to eliminate rodents and suggests you turn off ANC to prevent it... which is aggravating. ANC is the only thing that makes these worth such a high price tag and Sony is the only brand with that problem. Also, I'm 90% sure their explanation doesn't even apply to my environment. 2) Just two weeks after I bought them the touch controls started FREAKING OUT, detecting gestures when I wasn't even touching them. It rapidly flips between playing and pausing my music, skip songs, flip between enabling/disabling voice-to-chat, etc. all on its own, making them entirely unusable when that happens. It happens every hour or two, and once it starts it continues until I turn them off and back on. When I contacted Sony about this, they advised me to just disable gesture controls in the app. That prevents it from pausing or skipping my music, but it does not turn off the pinging sound the headphones make when a a tap/gesture id detected, so you still hear rapid random pinging whenever it decides to bug out. SUPER annoying. 3) 4 weeks after I bought them they just turned off on their own suddenly 10 minutes after I finished charging them to 100% and would not turn back on. I tried a factory reset and they still wouldn't turn on. after repeatedly trying to turn them on, they finally did... for a second, but shut down right after connecting them to my device. I figured they were completely busted, but when I tried again a few hours later they started working again and were fine for a few day... then it happened again. No idea what the deal is, but it's happened 4 times now, so I need to send to Sony to see if they'll fix them. Based on past experience trying to use Sony's warranty for repairs on other products though, they're probably going to send them right back and claim nothing is wrong because it didn't happen during their 30-second inspection.To summarize, these are SO CLOSE to being the best wireless ANC headphones to buy right now IMO. I really love them when they work... whenever I have to use my much more expensive Airpods Max, they make me wish I were using the XM5s minus all the issues. When they work, I prefer almost everything about the XM5 over the airpods. Unfortunately they're ruined by a few really bad problems. I would recommend getting the WH-1000XM4 instead. They have the same noise cancelling performance and most of the other great qualities and haven't been plagued with bugs. They're slightly less comfortable, but the tighter fit makes them more secure, which can be a benefit for people who want to wear them while working out.","Reviewed in the United States December 16, 2023",AEOTFW5HGJ2HINJMRI4WHHGKSN3A,TRUE,29,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

The wearing detection did die since it seems to be baked into the earmuff hinges which don't actually swivel both ways unless u force them a little. The one issue i have is that the MOST useful gesture of them all is fully absent from the manual, which is you can use two finger long press on the right earmuff to activate/deactivate speak through, which is very nice to have if you're wearing them outside and need to have a quick conversation without removing your headphones or pulling out your phone, but then also want the speak through to go away so it doesn't interrupt your music when you're done talking.","Reviewed in the United States July 20, 2024",AHXLSME4XDIXKIGPCTACSCCGNTTA,TRUE,0,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
R6HAEDDWZFUC9,B09XS7JWHH,4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent noise-canceling mic!,D. Johnson,4,"Negatives:The band is tight. I cannot imagine wearing these throughout a 4+ hour airplane flight.But that's part of the extremely effective noise reduction.The app's server connection was unreliable for me, and the login process far to ""secure"" with difficult capcha matches, and after each failure, one's password must be re-entered. But you don't need the app for excellent function.Positives:- Outstanding microphone noise cancellation. This is active all the time, whether or not ANC is on for listening. Speaking over to phone from a coffee shop (ceiling music, arguing staff, dishes clanking, a family conversation and squalling baby 15 feet away), the listener could hear little or no background noise.It is very, very hard to get any information on actual performance on noise-canceling mics in buds or headphones. I finally found soundboys-dot-com, who way down near the bottom of their reviews have actual recordings in standardized noisy environments.I've slowly migrated, over 6 years, through three units: First, an ANC open-ear headset with a boom mic that I assumed would work well because close to my mouth. My wife casually observed that I spoke very loudly when dictating, especially. I wrongly thought this because we don't hear our own voice well when our ears are covered. Then I forgot these on the train, and bought Beats for convenience -- the band and magnetic latches in the buds make loss difficult. These surprised me by having MUCH better mic performance -- never needed to raise my voice in a quiet environment for good speech recognition. But in noisy environments (riding in a car or airplane. sitting an an airport waiting area, cafe, etc.), they failed. With dictation, I had to cup my hand over my mouth and the mic to avoid unseemly shouting, and then quickly hold the mic in my hand to suppress the noise during my silences. It's interesting to me that voice recognition works better with ANC off, because then I hear my own speech volume more accurately and can modulate that realistically. Yes, one does need to speak louder in a very noisy environment, or simply talk into one's hand to reflect the sound back to the mics when one wants to be private. These Sony headphones are exactly what I need.For me, the excellent music quality is simply the frosting on the cake. - One can plug in a standard mini stereo plug and the phones just work.. (There are stereo to USB adapters readily available.)","Reviewed in the United States March 16, 2024",AHIHTL4O3CIE2AWYZX7BF6KMG4RA,TRUE,3,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
R3C9FB6LLL4I7I,B09XS7JWHH,3.0 out of 5 stars Headphones are Mediocre,b,3,"*Disclaimer: I bought mine used ""like new"" or ""very good""I bought these because they're rated one of the best headphones on the market, I HIGHLY disagree. Are they bad headphones? No. Are they worth the money? No, not even on sale lol. I returned mine and bought the Sony WH-1000XM4, and here's why:**Noise Cancellation (6/10): This feature was ok at best. The Apple AirPods Max are still top of the line for noise cancellation - I hear nothing when I wear them. With the Sony WH-1000XM5, I can still hear a lot of sounds around me. I'd say it cuts out maybe 60-70% of noise. My biggest issue here was that the noise cancellation would turn off randomly - so I would have to manually turn on/off the noise cancellation and ambient noise, which was just irritating.**Sound Quality (7/10): Sound quality was fine, it was nothing exceptional. The first day I received them, something really weird happened and the sound went completely muffled - like I was underwater. I looked up the issue and there have been similar issues for other customers who bought these headphones. The sounds went back to normal the next day, but I was already skeptical about their performance.**Comfort (9/10): I think they were really comfortable. I wear plastic framed glasses, so headphones that work with them can be a mission. The Apple AirPods Max do not work with my glasses at all, they pinch my frames and move them around - I need to wear contacts with them. With the Sony WH-1000XM5, this really isn't an issue. I needed to adjust my glasses every once in a while, but maybe once in like 3 hours. I think they're one of the best fitting headphones for people with glasses. Also, when I went to adjust the headband portion to make them shorter/tighter, they would slip - they just would not stay adjusted to where I needed them (this could be because I bought them slightly used, so it could have just been from previous wear - but still an issue if they become loose over time).**Product Quality (6/10): The headphones themselves are cheap plastic and just feel flimsy. For almost $400, you would expect them to feel a little better or more sturdy. I was constantly worried I was going to break them. The case is nice and hard, and I personally think they store nicely and are easy to travel around with. I bought the beige ones (again, I bought them slightly used), but the case was dirty and it stains easily since it's made of cloth material. The foam on the ear part is very soft, so it's kind of just your preference there. I think they felt a little cheap, but I also think that they added to the comfort.**Battery Life (9/10): The battery life is fine, they last pretty long. I'm studying for the Bar right now, so I used them for about 10 hours a day. They would last like a little over 10 hours for me before needing to be charged, and charging only took max 3 hours.**Connectivity (5/10): I had huge problems with connecting them to my Mac, I have no clue why. But, just so everyone knows, you need to download the app (Sony Connect) to connect it to your phone and your other devices. They just weren't discoverable on my Mac. I restarted my laptop and the the headphones, downloaded the app, connected them to my iPhone, updated my Mac, etc. It took me like 2 hours to get them connected to my laptop. I'm not sure if I am just technologically challenged or if they just aren't compatible with Apple products, but this process alone made me feel rage that I never thought I would feel.**Aesthetic (7/10): The headphones looked ok on. The ear part was kinda too clunky for my liking. They stick out a little more than other headphones, so I kind of felt like a bear when I wore them.**Overall (7.5/10): I think the headphones are meh. I just wasn't impressed for headphones that are rated sooooo highly in every article online. I did a lot of research and was torn between Sony WH-1000XM5, Sony WH-1000XM4, and the Bose QuietComfort 45. I decided against the Bose only because you cannot turn on/off the noise cancellation with buttons. So between the XM4 and XM5, I picked the XM5 because they were rated so well in online articles, I liked the look of them more (from pictures), and I figured I would just get the most up-to-date model. I returned them mainly because of the connectivity problems, noise cancellation, and sound quality. I just don't think they're worth the money, especially retail price. I just got the Sony WH-1000XM4 and they are SO MUCH BETTER. The sound/product quality, noise cancellation, connectivity, etc.Final Thoughts: If you want top of the line headphones and have the money to spend, get the Apple Airpods Max. If you want great headphones for a better price, Sony WH-1000XM4. The Bose are apparently SUPER comparable to the Sony WH-1000XM4 and are cheaper in price too. So, if having buttons to turn on/off noise cancellation is irrelevant to you, then get the Bose QuietComfort 45.The end.","Reviewed in the United States June 13, 2023",AFWRUIE4QDPQYPQOK3LVEKELRT4A,TRUE,76,Color: SilverSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
R1SZPJ7YA17UMK,B09XS7JWHH,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great ANC, Passthrough, and Audio Quality, but less comfortable and missing previous features",Kyle Zdunski,4,"I'm no audiophile, just a bit more picky than most people, but you can find resources online with exact specifications about the audio quality. They're certainly the best sounding headphones I've ever gotten.I own both the previous models, the WH-1000XM3 & XM4, and the quality of the sound, noise cancelling, and passthrough mode has gotten better with each iteration. The passthrough on these compared to the XM4's now feels lile night and day, as these allow me to hear my surroundings far better.However, I have had a few small issues with these. The redesign of the headphone strap looks and feels more modern with a higher build quality than the previous versions, and they're slightly lighter, but they're a bit more uncomfortable to wear for long periods. The strap is thinner, so the pressure on the top of my head is spread out over a smaller area, which begins to hurt after a couple hours if I don't wear a hat or hood to spread out the weight a bit. This is also somewhat avoidable by simply adjusting their position on my head every once in a while.One advantage these have over previous models is the ability to seamlessly switch between two connected devices, but this has it's issues. I use a Samsung phone and a Windows PC, so results may vary, but often the computer will just take control of the headphones despite not playing anything. For example, I double tap the right ear cup to pause something playing on my phone, then a few seconds later, do the same to resume it. For some reason, the headphones often decide to switch control to the computer during that brief pause window, resuming whatever was playing on it, or just doing nothing at all if nothing was playing. This happens even if all the audio on the PC is muted, no programs are open, and no media is or was playing.The XM4's had a handy solution for switching devices: NFC. I could hold my phone up to the headphones to quickly connect & disconnect it, making switching between devices quick even though only one could be connected at a time. I always knew which device the headphones were currently controlling. However, much to my surprise, the XM5's completely lack any NFC functionality. This would be fine, if connecting to two devices at once didn't have this issue. It's not a dealbreaker, though, as I just have to remember to disconnect them from my PC when I get up, or spend a few extra seconds getting my phone out of my pocket every time I want to resume something I was listening to.If you get these, here's a tip: don't clip your nails in passthrough mode. Something about the sound of clipping nails causes the passthrough mode to make a loud, high-frequency noise and shut off for about a second. This also happens for some other loud sounds, but clipping nails consistently causes it.In conclusion, I do believe that the XM5's were a worthy upgrade for me from the 4's. The improvements in noise cancellation are a godsend when there's constant noise around the house, which is all the time. I do wish there were an option to turn off the weird adjustments the ANC makes sometimes to try to adapt to the environment, as occasionally it will try to adjust each ear individually, resulting in a weird pressure sensation in my head due to the uneven audio cancelling.","Reviewed in the United States January 9, 2024",AGRX6WBOY2N4OUUYQ7WYTBZPZEPQ,TRUE,27,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

REW7IJXPA0PZ9,B09XS7JWHH,"5.0 out of 5 stars Smaller heads, folks with hair, and sensitive temples..read this",Bast,5,"First off, I havent had a chance to test all functionality yet. I am coming here in hopes of helping someone else out with their frustration.If you're nervous about dropping the money, do it. The app (if you let it) will track your usage. Get them, set an alert for a day or two before the return period is up. Try them out and then check your usage when the alarm goes off. If you need/use headphones I almost guarantee youre going to find these worth it.RE: Small headsYour head might not be too small. I realized after two days of use I was fitting them more like traditional headphones and they were siting on one or two lobes very slightly.When you fit, and while you get used to putting them on, I suggest:- lengthening the headand (as app suggests)- 'scooping' your ears lobes up and inside the pads rather than under them at all- then gently fitting headbandOnce I started doing this my fit issues nearly dissappeared(hair..). Biggest issue now is the band material is not grippy at all and I have very smooth/slick hair, so it wiggles a bit. If I troubleshoot around this I will update.Of note and Re:Sensitive TemplesThese do not need to be as secure over all (other than having the suction over the ears) as you will not want these to get wet, period. These are not designed for exercise or heavy movement. They are sufficiently set for walking around or hanging out, this protects you from losing suction without significant pressure on your temples and keeps these super light headphones EXTREMELY comfortable. Which for someone like me that gets migraines with nearly ANY temple pressure has been... life changing.The suction aspect for proper noise cancelation is fairly fundamental. It's an even bigger deal with these as they'll adjust sound and I could see if suction was lost at an inopportune moment it could be...uncomfortable.RE: HairY'all, your hair is going to need to be out of the way. I have already noticed that one or two small strands will absolutely affect the seal. I won't notice it immediately but when I move around or talk I'll notice a sound change (almost like a varying level of wubba womp like entering a tunnel or in elevation changes) and at the corresponding ear I'll find hair between my ear and headphones. If you experience this in one or both ears...check for anything preventing a seal! It's annoying to navigate but as with adjusting the fit as above the more I do it, the easier it is to do upfront/as second nature.The app is fairly easy to navigate but has a small learning curve, nothing atronimical. The only other app ive used for headphones was Jabra about 2 years ago. Theyve likely updated since but compared to the 2020 Jabra app..this app is night and day better in terms of navigation and ease of use.So far my only con has been switching between my TV and my phone. This could be me, I think this may just be a learning curve I havent yet had time to solve. What it was doing: Paired to both. Switched to phone to do some Duolingo. For some reason any adjustment i made unpaused my TV and swapped where the sound was coming from. When I re-paused my TV I'd have to reselect my phone..and then it would do this again. So for now Im just leaving the TV unpaired. I mostly dont need this anyway but thought it might be nice for my neighbors late at night.Summation without even talking about its sound quality, noise cancelation and other functions (which are amazing):These headphones are worth the price tag for the lack of weight on my temples ALONE. Everything else is icing on the cake.If something changes I will absolutely return here to update.","Reviewed in the United States January 18, 2023",AFPONOVKTZQCDIHE5RWXZ7J5NQEQ,TRUE,89,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

R1YW8QI0C833VS,B09XS7JWHH,4.0 out of 5 stars The MX5s are not perfect but I am still happy with my purchase.,Alex,4,"The MX5s are not perfect but I am still happy with my purchase.I originally owned a pair of Bose 700 so my comparison is against them.BuildThe build of the MX5 is on par with the 700s. They have a matte finish which feels nice and grippy to the touch. The buttons have a nice feed back when pushing them. Compared to the 700s the feedback is night and day. For the 700s I would often think that I was hitting the button because it had such lite feedback with a squishy feel.The weight of the MX5 seems to be just a bit lighter than the 700s which I count as a positive because 700s relied more on the headband to carry the weight of the headphones versus clamping force against the ear cups. The MX5s have slightly lighter clamping force on the ear cups but not too little that they feel like they will fall off. They are a great balance of clamping force and weight that neither the headband nor the clamp force feel like they are carrying the full load. The lighter weight and balanced clamping force make them very nice to wear for long stretches while working. Compared to the 700s I would often start feeling fatigue on my head where the headband would sit because all the weight was supported across it.The ear cups are also a bit wider on the MX5 but a bit shallower when compared to the 700s. I have ears that stick out a bit more so with the 700s the extra room is welcome. The shallower MX5 do fatigue my ears after a while of wearing them but this was after a full day of wearing them.The headband adjustment is a bit sticky for my taste. It's a bit difficult to adjust the MX5s because the fulcrum point get the leverage to adjust them sits much higher along the headband compared to the 700s which I can easily adjust with one hand if needed. However, its the 700s would also lose the adjustment very easily compared to the MX5s when moving around because they rubbed against a headrest.Noise CancellingI won't focus on the sound quality because I am not an audiophile. However, the noise cancelling is fantastic. I would consider them to be a step above the 700s.Extra SettingsThe app gives you a ton of settings to play around with. The main things I find to be better than the 700s is that the MX5s bluetooth is much better. I live near a rather large radio antenna so interference with wireless signals is extremely high. Walking in the other room my 700s would start breaking and stuttering teh signal before disconnecting. The antenna for the MX5s must be better because I can go a bit give or take an additional 5-10 feet. Also when using connecting to 2 sources the switching is seemless. Once sounds stops on one device the second device starts playing right away. My 700s sometimes would refuse to switch and be stuck on one source until I would restart the device or manually disconnect one source.The app also lets you assign the noise cancellation double a triple tap actions to start a directly interact with a service like spotify. Actually only spotify. I wish the button customization would be opened up to other actions since I don't use spotify its a dead feature for me. The same button can also turn off/on noise cancelling but rather the headphones given a verbal sentence like ""Noise Cancelling 5"" to let me that I am in ambient sound mode. I need to learn the sound of 3 different tones. The 700s would do and I miss that feature and they would also let you customize the noise cancelling levels that you could cycle through. I'd like to be optimistic and say that sony can adjust these features later but they don't appear to be in the habit of adding features to the app. I also own a pair of the XM4s which are the in noise canceling headphones and I haven't notice anything new in the app since I got them.","Reviewed in the United States May 25, 2022",AFQGJAMQZAQF26CB2DVPM4VZVYEA,TRUE,29,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

XM5 sound amazing.Comfort - Super light and really comfortable. Headband doesn’t bother me at all. Trick is to expand the headband so it doesn’t rest on the top of your head that much. APM are too heavy, Bose feel slightly better than XM5.Features - They are the best you can get.Controls - Amazing, touch controls work great!ANC and Transparency - ANC is really good and on par or better than all other brands. Transparency on APM sound like you’re not wearing headphones, XM5’s transparency is much better than XM4 but do sound electronic, like you can tell it’s coming through the mic. It’s no APM but 2nd best for sure.Build Quality and Design - Plastic but that’s a good thing because they are lightweight. IMO they look better than anything else.Multipoint Connection - Set it up in the app and you are good to go with 2 devices. Stop playing on one device start playing on another. It’s seamless for the most part but sometimes you may have to reload the video or song to get it to play.Headphones are really subjective to the user. What I’ve learned is sound quality and comfort matter more than anything. There aren’t any headphones that are perfect and check all the boxes but the XM5 IMO are the best on the market.","Reviewed in the United States June 1, 2024",AHRRPRN7Y4X3UP2Z3YN6EWQJCUVQ,TRUE,25,Color: Midnight BlueSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
R128VBKHE4O3F8,B09XS7JWHH,"3.0 out of 5 stars Too heavy, they get sweaty, even under normal temps, sound is OK but nothing to get excited about",Ty,3,"First, if I spend almost $350 on headphones, I expect a superb reproduction of my music. If voice/sound canceling was my goal, I could buy a $20 set to talk on the phone. I also tried the Bose and they too had great noise-canceling capabilities Again, that is not what most people buy high-end phones for. Maybe I'm old school, but I believe noise-canceling headphones are a new phenomenon, and the reproduction of sound quality is secondary. Honestly, I can't justify the price. Besides the discomfort, their heavy weight, and the excessive amount of sweat they produced, meant that every few moments I had to let my ears dry off due to the non-breathable plastic material of the cup covering the ear). After a while, they hurt. Sadly, I will be returning the Sony's and continue searching for a more refined musical reproduction. The accompanying software is not useful and really would not be needed for noise-canceling or if the phones produced a pure sound. One last thing: They just didn't give me the feel of pure joy and appreciation of enjoying music's separation of sound I don't mean stereo but rather ""Spatial"" without artificial tampering. If you've ever listened to music that has noticeable sound stage separation, you begin to appreciate the sound engineers who achieve that sweet spot. To be fair, music and how it sounds is an objective experience. I did not use them with a turntable. I bought a spare pair of inexpensive Sennheiser's for $30 with noise reduction. I have them on right now and while they're ok, you readily accept them because they're great for the price.

R22XJZQKTNXP33,B09XS7JWHH,3.0 out of 5 stars Went back to my Bose 700s,Abby,3,"TL;DR: The sound is decent but not mind-blowing after you get the EQ dialed in. Before dialing in the EQ, they're very average and even a little muddy; definitely not worth $400 imho. They also creak ENDLESSLY while wearing glasses (not necessarily the fault of Sony but it did happen, it did annoy me, and I did return it for that reason). They sound very compatible to Bose 700s. If you choose to buy these, absolutely wait until they're $250 or less.About me: I am an amateur audiophile. I have 20 years experience being fussy about the sound that comes out of audio devices. It has to be at least good. I can't stand it when you're listening to something and it's muddy or obfuscated or doesn't give you the full sound because of inadequacies of the device. That being said, I don't know all the audio-related terms or specs and I am not an audio engineer.I read a ton of reviews and watched a ton of YouTube videos (especially from This is Tech Today) about these headphones. I am a longtime Bose fan, starting with the QC 15s, then the 35s, 35iis, and now the 700s. I used the 700s for almost 2 years before I started itching to know what else was out there. I came across This is Tech Today's multiple videos showcasing the sound of industry leading headphones, and I was horrified by how flat and awful the Bose sounded. Clearly I was missing out on a LOT.Price and feel----I bought these Sony XM5s at full price (long story, don't recommend it). My first impression after receiving them is that they certainly didn't feel like $400 headphones. MAYBE $200, but that's a tough maybe. The material is very light and eco-plasticky. They feel like that plastic that's designed to be biodegradable (I don't know if they are; that's just what it feels like). I was prepared for that based on others' reviews, so I didn't hold that against them initially.Comfort----When I first put them on, they were comfortable enough. After long wear sessions with my Bose 700s, I found the band to be a little uncomfortable on the very top of my head and I was worried these would be similar with the same form factor, but they're light enough that they are comfortable for long periods.Sound----At first, the sound was disappointing. Like all of you, I have certain songs I use to test sound from various devices and this was not giving me the full effect of these songs. I went to the internet for some EQ recommendations specific to the XM5s and this made a HUGE difference. They sounded pretty good.I no longer had my Bose 700s at this point (sold them to purchase these because I'm not made of money), but I used my partner's Bose QC35ii to test against. I didn't realize this until I went to test, but the Bose 35ii don't have an EQ setting in the Bose app. You get what you get. And what I got sounded VERY comparable to the EQ-adjusted XM5s. I spent a solid hour listening to the same test songs over and over with both, and while the Sonys come out just a little bit ahead, it's not a difference you're going to notice if you aren't directly comparing the two side by side. I wouldn't even miss it knowing about the difference if I had to use the QC35ii.Sony app----This app looks like it's from 2005. It's a little painful to use. I could learn to live with it, and it does what you need it to do, but it certainly isn't an easy or enjoyable app to use as of June 2023.The creaking----This is what did it for me. I wear glasses. I also wear headphones/a headset for 8 hours a day for work, and then another few hours for gaming in the evening. Without glasses, these creaked ever so slightly once in a great while. They're made of plastic so it's going to happen, and I could live with that. However, once I put on my glasses, the cushions against my frames creaked when I breathed. Or blinked. And if I turned my head, good lord the creaking. It was all I could hear, even while listening to music at inadvisably loud volumes.The verdict----I returned these and re-purchased the Bose 700s and I couldn't be happier.Again, I'm no audio engineer. I'm not claiming to be. But for me and my use cases, and my personal opinion on the value for money, I'm giving my money to Bose. I get more for less.","Reviewed in the United States June 27, 2023",AHF7JA3YLXY3XBZPWQ5JRAKZVQJA,TRUE,60,Color: SilverSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

But be very aware there is NO IP rating!!! If you plan to use these for workouts and are worried about your sweat or rain ruining these be cautious due to there not being an IP rating.Included Case: The included case is nice. Glad one came with it due to the of course wild price. Be aware though these headphones do NOT fold like the previous version. So yes the case is a little more bulk.Sound quality and Noise cancelling: The Sound quality is decent to pretty good. I will say I wish the equalizer was better with added channels to change. Despite sound quality being decent/pretty good the Noise cancelling is king on these! Sony has been Kong when it comes to noise cancelling and you WILL notice this with these.Features/Gimmicks: Now depending how you see these you may consider them to be Gimmicks or features. The Auto Adaptive sound control is pretty good. It will automatically adjust ambient noise depending what you're doing and it helps a bunch! Another feature or gimmick is speak to chat which can work but also not work. I've had times where I'm talking and it won't activate till after 5 seconds and sometimes 7 seconds. A point where time is crucial when speaking to someone you might as well take off the headphones or put your hand on the outer part of the headphones to instantly activate the ambient sound. So in terms of the speak to chat feature it can be seen more of a gimmick.Value for Money: This is the part where your wallet will cry and hurt. These are super expensive for headphones I must say! But In terms of Value for Money. It's at a crossroads of yes is it a good value but also not. But I will say this. You're better off getting these on a good discount. I got these on an early black Friday deal here on Amazon. But I found out on November 9th it was at a price of $255 using a price history extension for Google Chrome. So technically this deal they had on these for Black Friday was a really bad deal. So my compulsive buyer syndrome got the best of me. Overall all for price.

R20WK709QH8M66,B09XS7JWHH,5.0 out of 5 stars Absolutely amazing.,Amazon Customer,5,"I used to own a pair of XM3s for quite a long time. I loved them so much. Bought them at about half the price than these. I wore those suckers out, accidentally broke them cause I'd use them to fall asleep and.. yeah, still worked but not the same. The price point on these XM5s is obviously super high if you know how numbers affect your bank account. I was kinda lucky because everyone I know for the past 3 years just gives me Amazon gift cards for special occasions (birthday, Christmas, etc) After literal years of browsing Amazon and not committing to using gift card money cause nothing sounded worth it, I finally purchased these. And still paid 150 dollars out of pocket. I have to say they are absolutely amazing. The noise cancelling is awesome (like incredibly good), the sound quality is... I pulled up a song on YouTube that I first heard 15 years ago (and still listen to it's not a memory lapse) and I swear I was hearing little details of the song I had never heard before. Comfy, awesome battery life, lightweight but doesn't feel cheap (better not).

R16NN9RX85ZWB2,B09XS7JWHH,4.0 out of 5 stars Wonderful Sound - but - Feels Cheap,Vinny9151,4,"Bought these to replace my aging Vmoda Crossfade II. Read a ton of reviews and decided to go for it. Out of the box, they sounded ok, but really came alive after messing around with EQ - using the Sony Connect app and/or a 3rd party EQ I've had for years. Very comfortable phones. Good sound imaging , great separation. Bass is punchy and tight after EQ changes; mids are fine and top end is pretty crisp and clear. There is a world of difference in sound between using my S22 Ultra and MacBook. Mac sound is pretty muddy and lacks presence. Using LiveOne on the S22 is 500% better; very clean and clear sonic attack. The Sony app is fine; lots (maybe too many) things to look at and think about. The thing I really don't like is how they feel when I handle them - very plastically - and honestly - kind of cheap feeling. Ear cup cover material seems low grade and a bit thin. And those ear cups - yucky feeling plastic. I would expect a better build quality (more solid feeling materials). Maybe the decision to go with plastic was a cost of design issue, in order tokeepp the price down and remain competitive. However, a product which sounds as good as these deserve better materials. Not sure if I'll keep them - need a few more days to make that decision. Bottom line: you gotta be your own judge, decide what trade offs you are willing to make to get the features you want and the that matter most. Also bought Boweres and Wilkins PX7 2Se. Will review them after trials.Update: I will be returning the Sony headphones. Although my comment about the plastic earcups still applies, I believe they would hold up as long as one was careful with them. Maybe the feel of the product is not important to you, but design and appearance count for me. Again the sound and features of the Sony is great.","Reviewed in the United States February 19, 2024",AEUWXIXKO7NYKKERCPME7ITHKHBQ,TRUE,1,Color: Midnight BlueSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

R31021WW6CLXL9,B09XS7JWHH,4.0 out of 5 stars Comparison to Bose NC700,mhans311,4,"I have used Bose NC700 for the past year, but saw these on sale for a great price and decided to try them. I had the XM4’s for a short time but had to return them because they were too creaky while wearing them. Luckily I have not had that same issue so far with the XM5’s. My biggest priorities for headphones is comfort, sound quality (both for music and phone calls), and noise cancellation.ComfortThe XM5’s have ear cups that are slightly larger than the XM4s and they also look slightly larger than the NC700s. This helps them go over the ears better. However, the NC700s have slightly thicker padding which makes the inside of the cup a little deeper. For this reason, I would say that the NC700s are a bit more comfortable for long periods. The XM5s are very comfortable, but after a couple of hours, I definitely start to feel them more than the NC700s. But both are great.Sound QualityThis is a matter of preference, but I prefer the deeper bass and fuller sound of the XM5s. I would say the NC700s have a more balanced sound, with far less low end. The XM5s really give a nice full bass, without it being over-bearing. I do prefer a bit more lower end than what the Bose provides. So for me, I prefer the sound quality of the XM5s quite a bit more than the NC700s.Call QualityI use my headphones for work calls several hours a day. Both the XM5 and the NC700 have great call quality and will work really well if you use them for phone calls or Zoom meetings a lot. I think I’d give the edge to the XM5s because they block out ambient noise slightly better than the NC700s, but the difference is negligible.Noise CancellationI mean, these are high end headphones and both do a great job with noise cancellation. I will say, I was surprised at how much noise the XM5s can block out. They block out voices and medium pitched noises better than the NC700s. They are both great with lower pitched things like plane noise. But I think the XM5s do a better job overall.Build Quality and DesignThis is where the Bose NC700s are just better than the XM5s. The build of the NC700s is just beautiful. They feel substantial without being too heavy, and there isn’t a seam anywhere. I also think they just look amazing. The XM5s do have seams around the ear cups and they feel much more plasticky. The XM5s are not bad, but they just are not as good as the NC700s as far as design and build quality.Battery LifeThe battery on the NC700 lasts me around 13 or 14 hours. The XM5s last around 25 hours. So it’s a pretty big difference. Charging speed seems about the same with both.Odds and EndsFeatures of each are similar. They both offer pass through audio and it works well on both. Touch controls work equally well on both. The case of the XM5s is a little bigger than the NC700s, if that matters to you. One small difference that may make a difference to some is that if you want to use the cord to plug them into a 3.5mm headphone jack, the end the plugs into the NC700s is 2.5mm. So if you lose the included cord, you will need a specific type of aux cord to replace it (2.5mm to 3.5mm). Whereas the XM5 uses a regular 3.5mm to 3.5mm aux cord.Overall I do like these Sonys better. I just wish they had the comfort and build quality of the Bose. But because of the superior noise cancellation and sound quality, I’m going to be using the Sonys from now on.","Reviewed in the United States February 4, 2023",AETTXELYLNOYOKPRX647FKJQO2NA,TRUE,128,Color: SilverSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

RXP9X25616OKK,B09XS7JWHH,5.0 out of 5 stars Escape to silence and high quality sound,Thomas Volk,5,"I searched for the best of the best in noise cancellation, and these were consistently at the top of the lists. Short of putting some kind of physical sphere around your head lined with the foam they put into sound booths, I'd say this is it. It doesn't cut out everything, but I can't imagine a further reduction than these in the form of headphones.When you switch the noise cancellation on and off, you can hear the world again and see the difference. Someone can be standing right next to me talking, and it just doesn't get through. But a loud speaker nearby might still get a little through.Music sounds amazing through these headphones. These are the nicest headphones I have ever purchased, and listening to Spotify through these is like listening to the songs for the first times. I'm hearing delicate layers of sounds I didn't know were part of the song. The bass is rich but not forceful. I feel like I can hear everything in the song as it was meant to be heard while they created it in the studio.The only I miss from my prior cheapie headset was the physical volume adjustment knob right on the exterior of the headset. However, I'm usually listening to these on my cell phone or my Galaxy Tab A (like an iPad but Droid), and those DO have an external volume button themselves. So, it's only an inconvenience when hooking up Bluetooth to my Windows PC. In this case, I must have a little internal sound setting up on the screen to make it louder or softer, if the source content doesn't have a volume toggle like YouTube or a Streaming platform. Example is a game where the volume is set. Then I need the setting open.All in all, I'm extremely satisfied. They delivered on the best possible noise cancellation under normal circumstances. If you live next to someone using a jackhammer 8 feet outside your wall, perhaps you have bigger problems than these can solve! But the normal in-house noise, these should do the trick.","Reviewed in the United States January 29, 2024",AGMWATFS7EF7YD67666FGFMYVL3Q,TRUE,0,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

These worked sufficiently while also giving an impressive rendering of music fidelity - all things being considered.After a few years I wanted to see if an upgraded setup was available - so the research, shopping, and review reading led me to buy these Sonys - despite that brand name not being one commonly associated with HQ headsets in the audiophile realm.Honestly - “overall” - It has been a disappointing decision made thus far. I get the feeling that the ANC is where the tech was implemented, not necessarily in the fidelity, styling, or sound drive.Other reviews adequately describe the somewhat cheap materials used. The lack of any manual buttons or controls on the set, coupled with the total lack of any printed manual is cheap IMO. Its case and packaging appear to be recycled - as a demonstration of Sony’s participation in the myth of climate change - so the tech stuff like “duo CPU and 8 mics” thing - gets a little drowned out.The folks at Bose use to piss everyone off in refusing to publish specs. They would reply “just give our speakers a listen”. And to a large extent - I think that applies here.These headphones do have a very good frequency spectrum , SNR, and although I have not thoroughly tested it yet - I’d bet the ANC works very well.The minimalist will love the flat black (or silver) shaved exterior. The one little paper included in the box (besides ads and the warranty) is a safety sheet that only lists ALL the MANY THINGS you should NOT do with them. Nothing is written inside to say how they can be used or enjoyed.You must download the “CONNECT” app, create an account, and use the phone app to set up and control the headphones. NOTHING is possible without doing that. (One more tether to tie you to your phone).Of course you read the terms and agreement when you open your account too - (and they wouldn’t dare use any of your PI, nor would your privacy ever be invaded).So I listened to the sound - and it is as good - perhaps a tiny bit better - than my Bose.But at a much higher cost - AND not until signing up & using the app to adjust the Sound. They are very lifeless without setting up the equalizer AND pushing the volume to FULL. This is a must.I’m not sure they even have the volume output of the Bose. That is a major concern to me due to my particular use - AND that I do like music to be fairly loud (and clear).Lastly, iPhone users - if you don’t play the game of getting the latest iOs revisions, certain functionality may not be provided. So iPhone users be sure to check on that.With such a price tag - and so many ties to endure - to gain and maintain full functionality with these, it may keep “fence sitters” like myself from returning them (after going through so much just to test them out).“Others” - who seem so thrilled - throwing 5 star reviews on everything they try, (and probably listening to compressed MP3 formats) will give Sony the goAhead on these. But I am not so thrilled. I like quality to be in all aspects of the equipment. And I like the USER to be in full control.There may be more to what Sony is getting here - than their customers.","Reviewed in the United States March 21, 2023",AEEZ24AWUXL2IA4UYFS6IUNU3PNQ,TRUE,43,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
R1OBPEA64NBXVG,B09XS7JWHH,"5.0 out of 5 stars Simply amazing, and if you have the budget worth every penny",Nagisa11,5,"I have been using Sony noise canceling earbuds for the last couple of years. I own both the XM3 and XM4 models and I have come to really love both the sound quality and the extra features Sony has packed them. Fast bear on android is amazing, it works without any effort. The first time you turn it on or if you turn it on in pairing mode a picture of the headphones will pop up on a nearby android device and you just click connect, it is as simple as connecting air pods to an iPhone.Onto these headphones, they are exceptional. Battery life is amazing, but that is to be expected from any premium wireless over your headphones.The touch controls have a bit of a learning curve, but they are for the most part very good (I have one issue with them, but I will get to that later).The noise cancelling is amazing of course, but what is more impressive is the improvements made to transparency mode. It no longer picks up background noise from fans and cars as much as it used to. Support for Spotify tap means you can launch Spotify, and have it pick up where you left off without even touching your phone.The new safe listening feature tells you if you are listening to music at unsafe levels for too long. It keeps track of how much time you listen at various decibel levels so it can tell you if you have been listening too much.Sound quality is of course very good. Also, Sony's EQ is not the best, but for most people it is more than sufficient. If you like a bit more or less base you can adjust all of that very easily, and it comes with several presets.The issues:I have had three issues with my headphones so far. The first one was a strange bug where it identified to my phone as the FCC registered model number instead of as WH 1000 XM5 with a reset after a firmware update.The next issue is that I have not been able to get it to register with Google's find my device service, it is not a huge deal for me especially because I am less likely to leave the headphones somewhere that I am something smaller like earbuds, but it seems like that can be a bit hit or miss.The last issue is one that I alluded to earlier, and it is with the touch controls. These headphones do not have a physical Google assistant or any digital assistant button, instead you either say the wake word, or press and hold on the radio until you hear a tone. There is a strange bug when I tried to reply to a text that the Google assistant just read to me. It records my reply, but then says to push the Google assistant button to send or press and hold to record the message. You cannot push the Google assistant button, or you can do is press and hold which will just record the message so you cannot send your reply. However, this does not seem to be an issue when you just try to send a text, only when you reply so it is not the end of the world.Well, that ended up being longer than I thought it would. I hope someone has found this helpful because I just spent far too long writing it.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2022",AFAR5DY57O62LVBJOJ5WZYNM57XA,TRUE,79,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

R2OA6TGYZGNBOZ,B09XS7JWHH,5.0 out of 5 stars Practically exactly what I wanted,Joshua,5,"The noise cancelation is really good. Like really good. But there are a couple complaints. They won't always block the same amount of noise, so if you live in a semi noisy environment, that really changes the way you look at these headphones. You can hear when the quality of this feature specifically, drops or rises. A really simple fix though, just turn the volume up a little more. Then it really is just you and the music. The transparency mode I felt just slightly let down. It can be better. Speak to chat is much more powerful which upsets me because it's like you don't even have headphones on. You end up wanting that kind of immersion on demand when it's only attainable through the speak/hold to chat features. Of course when those are enabled, the volume of your music gets reduced HEAVILY, so you can hear what's going on. If you're just turning on ambient noise, you might find it muddy or just not as clear as you'd expect or want. An amazing feature with ambient noise though, is you can control how much noise comes through. This helps me a lot because if you are feeling overwhelmed by your environment, you can just turn it down or shut it off completely. I guess you can say you have a lot of choices between complete isolation, and near perfect immersion. The pros, in my opinion, really overpower the cons. The sound quality is amazing. You can expect crisp, clear, quality audio with insane customization. The separation and sound staging are quite precise I'd say, and with the app you can have practically unlimited bass while still maintaining crisp, prominent highs, that do not interrupt or drown out the mids. Of course the amount of depth these headphones have can only make you dream of what more they may be capable of. I absolutely love the equalizer because now you have such a range with your listening experience, you can resonate with music on so many different levels using the equalizer. These headphones are built for every genre of music BECAUSE they're so precise and customizable as far as sound goes. That's a massive plus, interpreting a song differently because you changed the way it sounded. The smaller drivers do not in any way take from the sound quality. They sound like quality headphones, and the volume control is consistent. The sound quality does not change until about maybe 90-100%. They fit nice, but I wish the design were more like travel headphones where you fold the cups into themselves. They feel very durable, especially the headband. The touch sensors are nice too, but I wish you could use both cups instead of one, so you can customize what taps do what. Overall, they were worth the money. They're for everyone, however you listen, and whatever you listen to. Your preference in sound can be a lot more precise using these headphones. I mean, they really make it hard to say another pair is better. I have grown a lot with these headphones, musically speaking. There are no boundaries in the world of music, and there certainly are not limitations to reach that boundless world inside these headphones.","Reviewed in the United States September 10, 2022",AEOV73IEEBQE3D2CLMDT4LF5REYA,TRUE,39,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

R2Y56TA2GYJYDC,B09XS7JWHH,4.0 out of 5 stars It’s not 100% Noise Cancellation,Worm,4,"If you want 100% Noise Cancellation, use ear plugs that are made for it not a pair of Bluetooth Headphones. Does it work great if you’re playing music or something, yeah. Having Noise Cancellation with music playing does help focus more on the songs. I wouldn’t rate the “Surround Sound”/360 audio as mind blowing, but it does the job. That being said, it’s amazing how clear some sounds can be, such as in Call of Duty… or Minecraft. Zero disappointment if you want clear audio since the ear cushion works wonders (Not sure how long they will last though). As for charging and using the audio Jack at the same time since Bluetooth doesn’t work while it’s charging, I found it a horrible experience. Just get a good charging brick, a decent length usb-c cable and charge the thing once it reaches 20%. Go eat, take a walk or do it in your sleep but that battery wasn’t lying about being able to reach 30 hours. Though I would only limit it to 20-24 hours before checking the battery limit by pressing the power button again and hearing it tell you the power level. I don’t plan on killing the battery health and you should too for this price point. As for the range, Bluetooth 5 is impeccable especially with a quality device and limited walls between you, your pc and the kitchen. As for volume control, it changes it by small increment, though holding on to the right pad with your palm does activate transparency mode and lower the volume so you can hear someone talk. Downloading the app will show you a few things btw. It’s just a little overpriced by maybe $80 bucks, but you can’t deny the microphone quality. It’s quite good on mobile but if you use OBS to record there is always that noise. That being said, it does isolate my voice quite well in a loud environment and the Noise Cancellation keeps me from hearing anyone talk though to how high I have the volume playing my content to immerse myself. But like I said, without any content playing you can still hear stuff through the noise cancellation but once you play something else on top it’s gold. If there was once feature they should’ve added it would be dual control on both ear cuffs instead of just the right. I’m not left handed but it would increase usability since I don’t always get the action I want done though to me lying down or whatnot and my hand gesture was a little off from the four main directions. Also can we get a PC App or settings? I hate having to use my phone to change a few things such as the level of noise cancellation or shutting off/on the gesture control. There are times when I forget to turn them back on and when I switch to PC/Mac I have to go back to my phone to turn those controls back on. If there is a desktop App, me not so bright. That being said, it’s a good product, just a tad overpriced.

R2G3A1TQELK0FJ,B09XS7JWHH,4.0 out of 5 stars Best Sound on the Market - Overly Sensitive Touch Panel Issue Common,BeanDaddy,4,"I LOVED my XM4s. I upgraded to the new XM5s to let a friend buy my XM4s. Sound quality seems about the same - still the best on the market that I've heard personally. However, I think the headphones themselves feel a little more fragile. The case also seems less sturdy, though it may just be a more efficient design. The only real complaint I have is the touch panel. It's very sensitive to hair, etc., and actually is triggered by simply moving my head or often nothing at all. It was really frustrated if it started clicking next and skipping through a queue of songs, so I turned off the touch controls entirely. I don't use them too much anyway and haven't missed them. BUT! Even though the touch control does not do anything now, it will still make the noise as if you are skipping a song. If only there were an update to stop that noise when the touch controls are off, I would be content with this workaround. PLEASE Sony, if you read this, just turn the touch noise off! I'm upset that $400 headphones have such a simple but significant design flaw which you can scour the internet to find discussions of, but as long as these headphones continue to offer superior sound quality, I would absolutely forgive and forget so long as I can turn the touch panel click off someday soon!","Reviewed in the United States March 3, 2024",AEA73WEVKLQR4Y5IYHR65D7FVP4A,TRUE,1,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

So I’m still on the fence.",Chuck1998,3,"Ok, I’ve had these for about 72 hours and as my title said, I’m still on the fence to whether or not I’m returning these.The PROS:*The ANC (active noise cancelling) is unparalleled in my opinion. Standing near my sink with the water running, and music at a very low volume, I couldn’t hear the faucet running. Like, at all. Even without any music playing, the ANC is amazing.*Great audio. I don’t know how it picked the song, but once connected to my phone it started playing the most chill and quiet slow beats of a song I’ve not listened to in a long time. I’ve never heard the song with such clarity. Flawless first audio impression.The CONS:*I gather that maybe they engineered these to be lightweight intentionally, as to not weigh down peoples heads for obvious reasons, but…I thought at least the circular part where the ear cup joins the bridge, would be metal, or metallic…but nope, plastic. It’s all plastic. And not just high density plastic, it’s that cheap low density plastic stuff. Like the cheap plastic you’d find in the cheapest toys section of a toy store. The entire thing feels…disposable. As if you get them for free when you board an airplane for a flight. After spending $400 on this, and opening the package, I INSTANTLY got a bad feeling it in the pit of my stomach, like I was ripped off by something on Alibaba, or Wish. These feel like disposable trash, folks. Which is the only thing making me contemplate whether or not to return these. I have a few weeks with Amazon prime to decide, so we’ll see. Like, usually with good tech you can feel the quality - either the specifications or the hardware. I can’t say that with these. They feel cheap. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯*This is a minor issue, but it irks me a bit. More of an FYI to you all. I have the black version. It’s matte black. Like that velvety smooth kind of matte black. Well, if you have oily skin, you might have a bad time. Unless you wash your hands obsessively before touching these…finger print magnets. Finger prints get everywhere. Instantly. I’d personally prefer smooth shiny plastic, as that coating will last longer (that matte coating WILL get scratched), and the shine of hard plastic wouldn’t show the finger prints everywhere. But anyways, that’s minor, and nowhere near as bad as the con of them feeling cheap.That’s pretty much it! They do an excellent job audio wise, but despite knowing that, I still feel like it’s throwing money away. The audio trounces my Air Pod Pro’s (and their ANC) by a mile, and I’ve not tried the Air Pod Max’s. But because they feel SO cheap, I feel like I’m getting ripped off. The case is nice tho, so they do lay flat - as you can see in people’s pics.I’ve not charged them yet, and I’ve used them loads…so I’m assuming their 30 hours battery life is legit.If you have Amazon Prime, go ahead and order them. You’ll have to gauge for yourself how you feel about the lightweight plastic’y feeling. If you don’t have prime, I’d hold off, try to find them in a mall or something to try out.It’s disappointing when you’ve been waiting for a model to come out for so long, and then you’re left…unfulfilled.

RD1KBOOEZR986,B09XS7JWHH,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Quality Headphones,Ryan,5,"I've had these headphones (which I bought refurbished off Amazon) for almost a year now and they're nothing short of phenomenal! Sony is really good at maintaining the application tied to the headphone user and the fact that I've recieved a number of helpful updates since buying these headphones has been great. I use these everyday for casual gaming, studying, and going to the gym. I recommend being cautious when using these when you're sweating a lot at the gym due to the sensors having an affect on sweat. I've noticed that the detection system build into the headphones doesn't necessarily work anymore due to how often I've sweated while wearing these headphones. One annoyance that I have is the ""Speak to Chat Feature"" which keeps turning on whenever I talk at the gym. It might just be my headphones in particular but even if I go into the app and manually select to turn this feature off, it some how keeps coming back and turns itself on again. This is frustrating when you're in the middle of a set while exercising and then all of asudden the headphones pause the music and ambient mode is turned on. Regardless, amazing headphones and I'd recommend them for anyone. I was hesitant to buy these initially due to everyone stating they do not hold up well in the gym but they still function well enough for my liking!In the second photo I posted, you can see the slight stain marks caused by usage in the gym. If you want to avoid this, getting the black colored headphones might be recommended. However, I have been able to clean these stains out with a cleaning wipe. Plus, these headphones don't leave finger prints on the headphones which I know first hand that the black ones do (which was annoying hence why I got the white ones).","Reviewed in the United States February 17, 2024",AETTEEK3UFST3ZTMT5PN3WPGY6DA,TRUE,1,Color: SilverSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

However is over priced.It has great sound, good noise cancellation and amazing battery life.The downsides:Extremely expensive (the performance does not justify the price).Noise cancellation: if you take the headset off for a seconds, the noise cancellation functions goes away... crazy setting! you need to switch off and on again. Very annoying.Volume control: Sony decided to play Star Wars and removed the volume at all! same with any other switch that previous headset had... so now you only have a power-on switch, that it is! and to pair and control the volume I have the following word for you: GOOD LUCK!The volume works with sliding you finger up or down. If you want to pause to tap twice. But hold on there, that you need to tap in the right spot, otherwise does not work (you might find yourself tapping your headset while walking, and it is hard to aim for the same spot!). The same with volume up and down. For some design reasons, the volume works in phases, so if you want to lower fully, you cannot, you are only able to lower bit by bit, repeating the action several times to get to the right volume. It is ridiculous. Takes a hell of a time and keep you busy with the device instead of enjoying your music/sound.The issue is very similar than the smart watches that has digital (virtual) control over functions, instead of having a wheel that you can operate with your fingers any time, including while wearing gloves. If you have your hand wet or you are on the move, it is basically impossible to operate the device. The mechanical wheel is the answer. The same with this headset: why the hell Sony removed the volume and pairing buttons? I wont buy the next generation of headset if they carry on this way.The device (headset) has been thought in a engineering environment, by engineers, not users. So it works precisely as the engineers defined, under the perfect conditions BUT life of the user is different. Try to volume up while entering a plane and having to carry your hand suitcase: impossible. Try to pair quickly with your rental car while on the go: impossible. The Sony headsets are a good piece of engineering but has huge challenges. My advise is to buy something alternative and not to spent so huge amount of money for a product that aim to re-invent the headset. Previous Sony headset did the job, was so hard to just improve on the comfort, the battery life and noise cancellation without the need of removing all switches in this new model?

These are the least painful and I can wear them much longer than others. They do cause pain after wearing extended amounts of time, but I find taking breaks lets me wear them most of the day. The noise cancellation, especially on planes, is sanity saving. I just went on a trip and spent 12 hours flying and in airports each direction. These were lifesavers. Plane noise, screaming babies, loud talkers, they handled them all with ease. Do I wish they would pack up smaller? Yes. Do I still think they’re worth taking? Absolutely. The battery life is so good, I never have to worry about babying them. For the annoying but not deal breaking stuff…they drop phone calls pretty regularly (but sound really good on calls).

R1ADKUSAWBANNE,B09XS7JWHH,5.0 out of 5 stars Surpassed expectations! Excellent for noisy apartments,Mike,5,"These headphones are a life saver! I live in a noisy apartment. My neighbors below me feel the need to blast their home theater stereos at all times of the day and night, and I wasn't expecting much from noise cancelling headphones considering how obnoxious the noise is, but on a whim I gave these a try.It's been a few days and I can confidently say that these Sony headphones work wonders! They are fairly lightweight, and they sit comfortably on my head for hours on end. The cups are soft enough so your ears don't feel squashed, and at the same time they do allow for decent breathability. This means my ears don't get hot after extended use, which was a common issue I had with headphones in the past. The headband is relatively comfortable as well; it doesn't dig into your skull once you figure out a good position for the headphones, though it might take a few tries to find that sweet spot.Sound-wise, again these headphones are top-notch. I'm no audiophile by any means, but they sound fantastic when listening to music or taking calls. The noise cancellation features work practically flawlessly. Even when my neighbors are making noise, the headphones cancel all of that out and reduce it at best to total silence, or (rarely) at worst, a very faint mumble. I noticed this tends to work even better when you have music playing, even at a low volume, in which case outside noise is completely negated. I also wear glasses so there is a small gap in the fabric of the cup which tends to let a tiny bit of noise in, but again it's barely noticeable especially when I'm listening to music.The volume controls on the cups are convenient especially when you're not by your computer or phone. Double tap on the cup to pause or resume audio, and swipe up/down to adjust volume. The microphone is fine; I haven't heard any complaints from others when I'm speaking during a call. Overall the connection quality to my computer is stable even with the unusual amount of Bluetooth interference in my apartment building.In short I highly recommend these headphones.

R1XVSTYW4Y4HBS,B09XS7JWHH,5.0 out of 5 stars Sony XM5 vs Bose QC ultra,Lori Fleury,5,I purchased both the Sony 1000xm5 and the Bose QC ultras to compare. I ended up going with the Sonys after lots of comparing and contrasting. In my opinion the Sonys noise cancelling was better although the Bose were good the Sonys were noticeably better in that aspect and I bought them for doing yard work/ cutting grass so that was very important to me. I will say I think the Bose out of the box had the edge in terms of sound quality but after messing with the EQ settings and researching what others were doing (thanks reddit) I was able to get the Sony headphones sounding just as good if not better than the Bose in the end. Both headphones are extremely comfortable and ergonomic. I did like the way the Bose button/ volume control setup was done more than the Sonys but that wasn’t a big deal to me. Also liked the way the Bose ear pieces were moveable making it very adjustable and easy to fold up into a smaller case. All in all can’t go wrong with either headphones both were great but like I said ended up going with the Sonys and are very very happy with them!,"Reviewed in the United States April 23, 2024",AH6WPLK32FEJAXMM6ZLHQMKI4GIQ,TRUE,2,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

RLEMTFYFMDL31,B09XS7JWHH,"4.0 out of 5 stars Decent pair of headphones, but stay away if you need good sound quality.",Jacob A.,4,"For reference, used these for a couple of weeks before ultimately selling them. I found the ANC to be exemplary, and honestly the XM5's look amazing (in my opinion). Can't comment on the mic quality since I never used it, but I imagine it's quite good. Comfort was a bit of a mixed bag, it was in theory very good, but the narrow headband caused some discomfort after a while of listening! Now, onto the reasons I sold them: the sound quality is mediocre and said discomfort was annoying. Now, don't get me wrong: they would probably sound decent to most people. But upon unboxing them, setting them up, and spinning up Spotify, I felt my heart sink. The bass is very boomy and overemphasized, with little sense of control, and the vocals were garbled into oblivion. Overall the sound just felt incredibly unbalanced and unsophisticated, kind of like it was playing underwater. Now, obviously take it with a grain of salt: the sound is probably fine - it's not like it's unlistenable. I instead bought the Sennheiser's HD 560S and couldn't be happier. So TL;DR: Probably fine for most people. ANC is good, design is futuristic, comfort is decent. But if you really enjoy listening to music and appreciate it's beaty, you should definitely look somewhere else since the sound clearly wasn't tuned for and doesn't even come close to HiFi or audiophile level.","Reviewed in the United States February 15, 2024",AFUMFEXAJTNJ4FWRDQ6HUQPTYP3Q,TRUE,31,Color: SilverSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

I skipped the current software update this time, and they’re sounding great.Original:I’ve used them for a few weeks now. They’re extremely lightweight, actually too lightweight for my liking. When handling them, they don’t feel like the price that they cost. The sound is just alright to me. I like that I can customize the sound based on my own hearing in the app called Find Your Equalizer, which makes them sound much better. The soundcore headphones are cheaper headphones, but their app does this feature really well, better than Sony’s headphones app. The noise canceling was great for two days. Then the headphones updated to the latest software, and noise canceling has basically been nonexistent now. I’ve not received support for this issue. The automatic switching feature between noise canceling and ambient isn’t the best. The most annoying thing now is that there is currently a high pitched ringing in the left ear that goes in and out. Resetting the headphones did not fix the problem as it did for some users. Only solution is to return them for a refund since they can’t be replaced.","Reviewed in the United States February 15, 2024",AHDUS4MLOG7II2YS3SYNPRC2HCPQ,TRUE,1,Color: Midnight BlueSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

I truly expected more out of it only because I thought that a device covering my ears would offer a more complete and immersive experience, but... it really doesn't. The sound quality isn't as good as my old airpods, (probably because they sit in my ear canals), and that's more or less the standard expectation I had when I purchased these. They do sit comfortably and I do appreciate how light weight it is, (also the fact that my ears don't throb after placing a device over them), but it's still a bit lackluster. I will say, the noise cancellation does a good job as does the wireless feature which connects well to any device I'm using, (phone, laptop, etc.) If you have doubts about my review, make up your own mind on this one, this is just my experience.","Reviewed in the United States July 5, 2024",AHT24SHX2RJEMLM5XUOPLQAKPDQA,TRUE,0,Color: Midnight BlueSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

R1QNWLVDNCOEPI,B09XS7JWHH,3.0 out of 5 stars Decent headphones,Lance L.,3,"The overall build quality was great with the use of some high-quality plastic(or some other nice and light material) The new design didn't seem to impact functionality although it might help with the duration of the headphones by removing the hinges. However, to put the headphones back into the case, they had to be fully un-extended, which means every time I took it out I'd have to take some time to adjust the length again. Speaking of the case, the magnetic cable slot from the Bose headphones' case was nice and worked perfectly. The only complaint about the case is probably the zippers consistently get stuck near the two ends. To the core now, the sound is excellent as always with Sony headphones. Personally, I thought it was slightly dull/dark with default settings and wasn't massive improvement from the previous gen. The EQ in the app did help tremendously and clearly reflected the changes I made and it was able to tune to my sweet spot. To be fair, I'm no expert in audio so take this solely as an opinion base review.In terms of the ANC, Sony nailed it again and it blocked pretty much anything... Meanwhile, be cautious when you cross the street with these on although I was able to hear some car sounds from larger cars. The ambient sound was pretty similar to the previous(meaning it's good) but I'd say it's not as natural as the Airpods series(Airpods Pro I'm comparing to here since I'm too poor for Pro Max :).Up until this point, it probably seems like a 5 star review but the following would be my complaints. First of all, the quick attention mode is a great feature but it would only work on the right side of the headphone as almost all other features on this headphone. All touch controls are on the right earcup while the left just has 2 buttons for ANC/AMB and power plus the wire jack. It'd be nice if there was the option in the app to choose which side the touch controls are on or just make it work on both sides. This is not possible and understandable if there's never a panel to do touch control on the left but that's probably good thing to add for the future. Also, I'm aware that I could literally just flip the headphone(as they seem to be identical except for the buttons) and wear the Right on my left year, but why?Anyways, moving away from the left and right issues. Something minor would be that I'd personally like to customize my touch controls but that didn't seem to be an option in the app as I've looked in and out for it. Not to say that there are any controls missing but I'd prefer to customize it.Lastly, something about connecting to 2 devices simultaneously is that it works but not seamlessly. I'm thinking it's more of an issue with the devices that I'm using(iPhone and iPad) which don't work exactly like devices in the Apple ecosystem. For example, when I'm connected to my phone and playing music on it, the headphone doesn't change to iPad automatically when I start to play a video on the iPad. To make it change devices (I've tested it multiple times), I need to pause the audio on the current device in order automatically move to the other device. This is still easier than disconnecting and reconnecting devices but could be improved(maybe?).Perhaps some of these issue could be fixed by updates perhaps not. I'm giving this 3 stars mainly for the fact that the price increased and not all of the features are completely flawless. I don't think the price for an upgrade from the XM4's or other headphones in similar price range is worthy. Don't get me wrong, it's great and all, just not worthy as an upgrade.","Reviewed in the United States May 22, 2022",AH3X5TK4L57XIHVIRZ7HAJGCBHVA,TRUE,9,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

For the price, these headphones are absolutely perfect and exactly what I was looking for. The sound quality is outstanding and they are so comfortable! I bought and returned a few pairs of over ear headphones before I decided on these ones. The ones I tried before always ended up hurting my ears if i would wear them for a few hours and then take them off, so I can clearly remember the moment when after a few hours of wearing these headphones, I took them off and I thought to myself “wow, these don’t hurt me at all!”I gave 5 stars because 4.5 wasn’t an option, but 4.5 is my true rating because the only complaint I have for these headphones is the noise canceling feature. It does a fantastic job for straight white noise which is nice, but it doesn’t do really anything in the way of canceling out voices or anything like that. That being said, the sound quality is absolutely fantastic, so if I need to block out all sound I can still easily do that by playing music, a book, or white noise. I’m very impressed with the sound quality.I also love the design of the headphone. They are not bulky at all and are easily compactable. They even come with a cute carrying pouch so the headphones won’t get dirty in your bag. Also, the battery life is additionally pretty nice. I prefer headphones with longer lasting batteries because i usually forget to charge them, so these have been perfect for me. They last a super long time and don’t take all that long to charge either!If you are still reading this review and have gotten all the way to this point, I say buy the headphones. They are honestly worth it. Also i change my rating to a 4.8, lol.

RCI19AFS45JRD,B08HDBZNZ9,5.0 out of 5 stars The best ANC headphones you’ll find under $40,ZuSu  (£цэ!#),5,"Since I live in an apartment, I use over ear Bluetooth noise canceling headphones to watch TV or listen to music on a daily basis. I have a Sony 1000-XM2 that I love an MPow M5 and Soundcore Q20. The Sonys are my gold standard for sound quality, but both the MPOW and Soundcore were exceptional as well.The MPow M5 finally started to physically break after 4+ years of years of near daily use, so I purchased these to replace them.I selected these because they were the among the highest rated and most purchased over ear noise canceling blue tooth headphones under $40.I received my headphones in about a couple days. The box contained the headphones, a carrying bag, and cables. The build quality of the headset feels good, but not premium. The construction is mostly mat plastic with metal hinges and of course a metal leaf spring in the headband. ANC is controlled with a sliding switch behind the left ear while on/off, volume, skipping, pausing and pairing are controlled with three plastic push-buttons behind the right ear.When you press the buttons you hear/ feel a mechanical click that I am guessing is designed to be hepatic feedback and less intrusive than audible beeps in the headphones. Primary function of the buttons are volume and on/off. Holding the volume buttons for a couple of seconds will allow you to skip forward or back. The center (on/off) button, also allows you to pause and when held for about five seconds will put the headphones in pairing mode. As the noise canceling is on a separate slider, you’ll need to remember to turn this off when you power down the headset or you might drain the battery. All controls seem to me to be very intuitive and standard.Sound quality is really good for the price. These is some punch in the bass but it isn’t overpowering. Mids and highs are clear. At the highest volumes the sound gets a tad muddy, but why would you crank the volume if you have noise cancelation? The sound quality is very good overall and exceptional at the price, on par with MPOW but maybe not quite as good as Soundcore Q20s. I imagine these are best suited for TV, movies, rock and blues music. Though if you like boomy bass or just super heavy bass, you might find the headphones weak in that regard.Noise canceling operates as a single mode without a bypass/ ambient sound feature which is expected at this price point. Noise canceling is at least reasonably good for this price point. Low frequency noise can’t be heard, but, mid-to-high frequencies are not affected much. The sonic profile does change slightly with noise canceling on. It’s hard for me to tell exactly what happens, but I think the mids drop slightly and I get an even more v-shaped sonic profile. In any case, it is a pleasing effect. Overall, noise canceling is what one can expect at this price point. If you need more mid to high frequency noise reduction, I’d recommend just getting a pair of Sony MX’s.Range is good. I can go anywhere in my apartment or even outside nearby with no loss of sound quality. Again, at this price point, I think this is expectedly good.The headphones have a “C” profile that sits a bit off the side of my head. I have a small to medium sized head, and I find these very comfortable, perhaps the most comfortable pair that I have every tried. The headset feels reasonable light and my ears don’t get hot with extended use.Overall I give this set extremely high marks for sound quality and comfort which are the two most important aspects of such headphones. Build quality, noise cancellation are expectedly good, and I see no major detractions, so I am giving this set five stars","Reviewed in the United States June 10, 2023",AGNQ4LZ7IDK54GIKCMDUKP5TZ35Q,TRUE,260,Color: Black

They worked so well, but then the I somehow broke the base on the left side, which overtime caused the attachment to the left earphone to fail. I couldn’t repair it so I ordered a new pair. Excellent value for the price. The noise cancellation is epic. It allowed me to study through 4 of my cousins (all under 7) running about screaming and playing while they were visiting.

I have a gym at my apartment so that’s what I use and I’ve been going when it’s just me so take my review with that in mind (aka not sure how this holds in noisy environments).For about $40 (I believe) it’s been great. Comes with a pouch, while the headphones is mostly plastic, the earmuffs are super soft! I have small ears & multiple piercings and it does not bother them at all. Sound quality is not going to be top tier. I had AirPod pros before this and the sound difference is night and day- however, over the course of a week I would say I do not mind the sound quality. It’s what you expect from something that’s about $40. Again, I had no high expectations as I wanted something for the gym.

My brother also bought a pair a few months later and the same thing happened to his.It seems like the quality of the newer models aren't as good as the one I bought for my sister 2 years ago.

Maybe if I turned my music volume up while the noise cancellation was on, it would fully shut out all outside noise, but I was really looking for 90% cancellation anyway. Like I can concentrate without background noise, but I’ll still be able to hear an intruder attempting to break in yknowI mainly bought these to use on long haul flights and liked the idea that they could be paired via Bluetooth or aux. They’re comfortable to wear even after several hours, unlike my AirPods, and are sturdy enough for regular use (may or may not fall off while running)The best part about these (aside from the $20 price) is the battery life. I’ve used these headphones for about 3-4 hours every single day for like 3 weeks and even left them on accidentally for a full 24 hours, and the battery still has more than 50% left!!

The headphones are also quite comfortable, with surprisinghly soft ear cushions.The only two minor drawback is that the build quality and the ANC, while decent, doesn't feel as premium as some higher-end brands but that is to be expected. However, considering the price point, they offer great value for money.

The drivers in these are very similar to other over ear headphones on the market, and the audio quality considering the price is impressive.

Physically they are the same. The noise cancelling is the same both passive and active. I forget if the TT had a voice telling things.The battery life is advertised as 40 hours. This is true if you don't use the active noise cancelling to which I recorded 48 hrs 22 mins and the volume set to 5. I ran two tested with active noise cancelling turned on. The first run got 28 hrs, 32 mins and I don't know what the volume was set to. The second run with ANC got 29 hrs 39 mins at volume 5. This is a far cry better than the TT headphones that couldn't manage 30 hrs with ANC off and under 20 hrs with ANC on.The voice telling what is going on; power on, connected (blue tooth), battery low and power off, is very noticeable and a bit loud. Getting disconnected is a simple set of beeps. It's the battery low warning that scares me every time it triggers. I really hope that this maker might put out a firmware update that either replaces the battery low with a more subtle beep or turn down the voice. It's actually the reason I took off 1 star, which I know might seem odd but it really scares the heck out me every time.The one thing I'm hoping they don't do which the TaoTronics version did is die after about 6 months. When I say die, I don't mean they can't hold a charge. I can still use them wired and with ANC being on a switch that still works as well. They simply won't turn on, press the power button and the power light briefly flashes and that's it. But if these (INFURTURE) do die within the same time period I will be back with a not so flattering update.Update: 09/19/2023There was one other reason for dropping the 1 star. The bluetooth range isn't great. Using the same transmitter in the same location as all of the other headphones I've used, these start to break up in half the distance.Update: 04/14/2024When the battery gets low the ANC light doesn't come on but ANC will still work. Once charged enough the light still functions as normal. Also there is now a loud pop when ANC is turned on, which wasn't there before.","Reviewed in the United States September 4, 2023",AHMHS3WOR4KAL4NW74TKHLKAKNEQ,TRUE,24,Color: Black

I imagine these would be rad to use to sleep on a noisy flight or in situations of sensory overload.CONS: Noise cancelling reduces the sound quality quite a bit and I wasn't a fan of how bass-forward they are. I also listen to a lot of instrumental + classical so it's entirely possible these headphones just aren't the jam with the genres I listen to most!

R2ZZMYGBILFRS1,B08HDBZNZ9,4.0 out of 5 stars HONEST REVIEW,Ashley Gibson,4,"Let me tell yall something about these headphones… these headphones are easy to connect to an iPhone, can fit on small heads and very comfortable around the ear. When I opened the box it came in a fake leather sack with 2 cords, I felt boujie. Very comfortable around the ears and it’s loud enough where if you turn the music all the way, it don’t blast loud and make your ear hurt like others do it’s just the right amount of loud if you don’t have bad hearing… it’s NOT NOISE CANCELING, but if you focus on whatever you’re listening to I promise you can get away with ignoring people you don’t wanna talk to! It was not reused it most definitely looks clean like nobody wore it. For the pricing it’s 100% worth it. Just don’t be weird about it being an off brand company if I put beats and this headset as a comparison, let’s say if it breaks it’ll still be worth it and cheaper and more reliable. I haven’t worn it to the gym yet but just know that loud clanging won’t bother you as much as AirPods would. I’ll give it a 4.5 only because the price is worth with everything that came with it as well as the comfortability, packaging, etc.","Reviewed in the United States March 2, 2024",AFBL6CZBWSIVZY36SD5BDQADDUCA,TRUE,3,Color: Black

R2JN34UCNA8WAQ,B08HDBZNZ9,"4.0 out of 5 stars Good sound, though didn't last long",Katrina,4,"First off, I love the fit of these. Very comfortable to wear for hours at a time. My ears are small and fit nicely inside so the foam doesn't push against them. There's not too much pressure on the head when wearing it though it does tend to slip off if you move your head up or down too far. It has survived a few drops on hardwood flooring without too much damage. I also really like how fast it charges up, roughly 3-5 hours, and it will last for a couple of days before needing to charge again (I wore them pretty much all day lol).For audio, the quality is good. No trouble controlling the volume with the buttons on the headphones itself. Max volume is pretty loud while the lowest volume doesn't get that low at all. You're better off controlling the volume through whatever device the headphones are connected to. Also, for the voice that plays when the battery is low, when you turn the headphones on/off, or when Bluetooth is pairing/connected, the volume of the voice is loud even if you are listening on low. There is sound leakage. Noise cancelling is iffy, just depends on what's going on around you. I've kept mine off for the most part and the earmuffs block out a good chunk of sound by themself. No issues with the other party hearing me while using the mic for phone calls.Bluetooth connection is fine but starts cutting out if you are more than 20-30 ft away. I like that you can be connected to two devices at once. If connected to two devices and you're actively listening to something on one of them while the other is not playing audio and audio starts to play on the other device, the one you're listening to stops immediately.Overall, I enjoyed using it and would likely buy another pair in the future if there were to be an updated version. My pair just recently broke (had it since May of this year) when I took it off.

R14HTFU7X2E16B,B08HDBZNZ9,5.0 out of 5 stars Nice budget headphones,Steve,5,"I bought these for relaxing while laying in bed or while exercising. I've never been a fan of ear buds. I think the shape of my ears makes most of them either fall out or become painful after a while. I much prefer the over-ear style like these. Plus, they are big enough to have an all-day battery in them, unlike most budget ear buds that only get maybe 4-5 hours.The noise cancellation is functional if you understand what it does. If you are expecting to put these on with noise cancelling enabled and not be able to hear what anyone is saying, you'll be disappointed. The noise reduction primarily works to drown out low frequency constant tones. Like you would get on an airplane, or in my case, a noisy furnace fan in the bedroom or the sound of a cross country ski machine while exercising. They don't totally cancel out the hum, but they bring it down to a level it's not as noticeable.I've had these for several months now and use them almost daily. For the most part, there have been no issues, although lately every once in a while, they will say ""disconnected"", then ""connected"" again. But oddly enough, it doesn't seem to affect playback. Those play over the top of whatever music is playing. Not sure if it is the headphones causing it or one of the devices I have them paired to.For the price, I think they are a good choice. I'd buy them again if/when I need another pair. Hopefully that won't be for a long time though.","Reviewed in the United States January 24, 2024",AF4K6PNQXENS77VL7VXAZMNLPYQQ,TRUE,1,Color: Black

I wish they would quiet those alert sounds, they have startled me every time. I also feel like if I don't pair it with my device right away it turns off pretty quickly, which I suppose is a battery saver, but combined with the jarring loud alert voice is quite annoying.I selected this pair based on number of high reviews, someone saying it fits a large head (it does, but not the most comfortable) and the lighter color. In real life the lightest one is VERY silver looking.

R1GVVTZOQ5DNBR,B08HDBZNZ9,"4.0 out of 5 stars good headphones, well worth the price",S. Bandyk,4,"They're not the highest fidelity headphones I own.. I've got Sennheiser HD 660s and PCX-580s.They're not bad sounding at all though. They provide a decent amount of bass for music, without being artificially boomy, and seem fairly well balanced otherwise. They're not nearly as transparent as my 660s and you're a lot less likely to hear new things in familiar music than you would be with higher-end headphones, but I'd struggle to find any faults if I didn't already own high-end cans.I purchased them because I broke the headband (cup mount actually) on my PCX-580s and I needed some closed-back headphones to wear when I'm running my shopvac and tools. On their own they're not hard-core sound-dampening headphones but they do take the edge off of the type of noise that can be dangerous to your ear health.The noise cancellation works. It's not the best in the business.. but it does cut the type of monotonous noise that noise cancellation is meant to deal with. e.g. I pick up RF buzz in the wire leading to my studio monitors (noisy monitor between them).. and turning on the noise cancellation totally wipes that whine out. I suspect it would probably quiet up an airplane cabin quite a bit too.. though I haven't traveled since getting them.Edit: Walked by some large mobile generators today with headphones on. By large I mean, they were powering a large University building while it’s mains were apparently bypassed. Turned noise cancellation on and off.. it did a very good job cancelling low frequency hum/rumble coming from them but not much of the higher frequencies they were making. Still think they’d do well on a plane.They're lighter than my BT PCX-580s, which I consider a perk.Battery life is very good…Edit: I removed a slight rant about a blue led staying on when these are powered off.. it’s the noise-cancellation led. Noise cancellation has its own on/off slider.I haven't been on the other end of the mic so I can't tell you how good it picks up a voice. I haven't had any complaints when I've used them on Zoom calls though.They're good enough and cheap enough that I'm tempted to buy a 2nd pair.. one to use with my computer in my office, and another to use as ear protection (with my phone).","Reviewed in the United States April 28, 2021",AG4QSKEM4R23DSWEVVIDIFXNPTXQ,TRUE,40,Color: Black

They are comfy to wear for long periods of time. I sometimes study for 8+ hours at a time while listening to music and they don't hurt like other headphones or earbuds that I've tried. The ANC is amazing if you have sensory issues and/or ADHD like I do. It won't completely block out loud sounds, but it definitely blocks out any annoying minor background noise that you just don't want to hear, which is always the issue for me personally when getting work done. So, it may not be great if you're looking for something that 100% cancels all background noise.The sound quality itself is almost as good as my Beats headphones. My only complaint is that when I have it plugged into my computer or iPad, sometimes the left side of the headphones won't work unless you play with the plug a little. That said, I do like that you can use them with both a plug and bluetooth option. Also, it smelled very bad coming out of the package; like a mix of fake leather and nail polish remover is the best way to describe it.

I am a simple girl, headphones sound good, I'm happy. I'm hearing parts of my favorite songs that I didn't even know existed. Also, several friends have told me they look cute on. :)Now I will say the material the headphones are made of feels a bit cheap. Not flimsy to the point that I feel like they are going to break, but they are definitely all plastic and creak a bit when I move them. I wouldn't recommend throwing them into your gym bag or a bookbag with reckless abandon.

If I hear too much or not enough, I cannot regulate basic function. These are game changers! ANC is excellent, tones down fluorescent light buzzing sounds, machine noises and background conversations. Still allows close range emergency sounds to be heard without startling me or muting out. Doesn't compromise audio quality of video or music while using ANC. Ear pads are large enough to cover entire ear and not too tight on the head. I have a small head and they are relatively snug without being painful. Sometimes I support them with a hat or keeping my hair up. SOFT pads and easy to clean with a antibacterial wipe. The pads rotate to lie flat against my neck when not in use. They fold up small and come with a carry bag that even fits my phone with the headphones together inside it. They hold a charge seemingly forever. The blue color is beautiful metallic and doesn't absorb or transfer head from the head. Have not tried them in high activity yet aside from walking. Might be a little heavy for some exercises but I am very happy with the purchase. I compared them to a similar price point s0*y blue oth pair and they were an instant choice for price and function.

The shape and style seemed very similar, so I decided to order these instead of spending hundreds for new Bose. I am an ASMR junkie and these were perfect for that! Very comfortable over the ear design and good sound. They do squeak a little at the joints, and the voice which announces ""powering off"" is super loud no matter what you have the volume set on. The sound quality didn't seem lacking compared to the Bose- in fact I found the volume of what I am listening to (such as sounds that were faint or almost inaudible on my Bose with the volume all the way up) to be even higher in these. All of the things I listened to before sound basically the same to my untrained ear. I'm not a music person, so I can't say anything about treble or bass. I do miss the ease of bluetooth connections with my Bose, these are a bit less accessible and the buttons/controls still confused me after a few months of use. The battery holds a VERY long charge (fwiw I don't use noise cancelling) which is amazing! They also recharge pretty quickly! Great purchase, I might even buy a backup pair because at this price I could afford to buy 4 pairs for one pair of Bose.","Reviewed in the United States September 18, 2023",AHH3K3B5VHVO3LOJ42QUXFUMWDQA,TRUE,13,Color: Rose gold

It’s really easy to use, it has noise cancelling, and has very long battery life. However, if you are looking for the BEST noise cancelling, this isn’t it. And I do recommend if u listen to music all the time at school, to bring the charger with you. It can charge on your laptop if your headphones ever die at school. I would def recommend as a student!! It’s affordable, and it does it’s job well.Imma compare them to AirPods: AirPods suck ass. They made my ears literally bleed LMFAO. Also they took forever to connect to my laptop or sometimes it will be difficult connecting to my phone, and I have an iPhone btw. Also these headphones can connect to both ur laptop and ur phone at the same time, it doesn’t over lap sounds though. But it’s convenient whenever there’s not a lot service on your phone and you want to listen to music, you can do so with your laptop in class. That’s def a pro for me because my school’s service sucks ass on my phone.

R1UBP3CBOE24CI,B08HDBZNZ9,5.0 out of 5 stars Very Impressive!,DWitzel,5,"The media could not be loaded. These headphones are amazing, especially for the price but even across all prices! I previously owned Beats Studios years ago and I returned them because I wasn’t impressed with the audio quality for the $250++ price point.I tested these headphones with music across all different genres and they deliver great sound, strong bass, and true silence in the quiet parts (no static or anything as I typically experience with cheaper speakers). The noise cancellation isn’t the best but does make a noticeable difference especially when playing music, it makes it sound richer and more immersive for sure!I really like the fit of these headphones too, I’ve got a big head and they fit great without having to extend the arms at all. The cups fit comfortably on my ears and the fabric on them feels high quality and does a good job at sound isolation. They feature nice controls on the headphones including play/pause, volume up/down, and previous track/next track. The build quality on these is great, they don’t feel too light but they’re not artificially weighted either (like Beats are!) The grip is great during high activity too.Perhaps the only room for improvement on these is the sound leak at high volumes, people can definitely hear what you are listening to if you’re over 50% volume but that’s not a major complaint for me.I really can’t recommend them enough, I already bought a second pair for my wife to use and my kids are enjoying ours so I may be buying a 3rd soon! 😁","Reviewed in the United States July 29, 2023",AHAGQHLOGSGXV7CYERJFWMRSHJXA,TRUE,34,Color: Black

R1F8IKLD5C754O,B0CGTL9GFD,3.0 out of 5 stars Other reviews are confusing,Josh P,3,"I think the people giving this an ""excellent sound quality"" review are maybe confused or aren't used to good headphones.I used a pair of $30 Jlab Neon headphones and the sound quality sounded much richer. When I got the Edifier, though, it's a very ""poppy"" sound (think Taylor Swift), that really emphasizes bright, poppy, higher-pitched noises. I had to play with Windows settings and then give the bass a boost - then the headphones became decent quality as far as sound goes.The material and texture look great, they're perfect for something in this price range. You're not getting premium metal, what other people don't tell you is that if you're a student, and you put metal headphones in your backpack or whatever, they tend to break and tear and it's just not good for them. These Edifiers are plastic, and the ends are finished for a ""polished metal"" look - they just look really good. If I saw these on peoples' ears, I would assume it's a high-end, different-ear-shape, $140+ headphoneBattery life is just crazy and insane. However, I really don't care about this - I'm a student, at my computer a lot, and I can just plug it into a charger at any time. On Youtube, some people tested it and got an insane amount of battery life (50+ hrs), more than advertised.So, sound quality is a solid 3.5/5 at best. You will 100%, absolutely need to add bass boost through windows if you want to really appreciate good sound and music. I'm not some audio tech guy, but I just appreciate and know good sound, and know the very basics of EQ - these headphones are capable of good, decent bass, but for some reason are tilted towards a poppier, springy, high-frequency sound (like I said, female vocals).Absolutely dope as far as the look goes. They're plastic, making them more durable than metal ones if you're throwing them in a backpack or taking them to the gym. Falls and drops and laptops and books hitting them will do nothing to them!And they're king of battery life.Imo I'd pay $30 - $35 for these. I'd return them if I'd bought them in-store, and get more sound-quality obsessed ones. For now, I'm fine I guess, relatively happy and a solid ""decent"" purchase; but it really, really, really depends on if you care about rich, luscious sound quality.","Reviewed in the United States January 30, 2019",AHE32BSPJYV27ESBLGWNX7EDS5GA,TRUE,12,

The bluetooth always connects fast and easy, and I rarely find myself recharging them! Also I can finally edit for long periods in comfort. Other headphones like Beats cost well over 100 dollars!!! I, like many, spent hours of looking at beats, sonys, and MANY other brands but decided to take a chance on Edifier. I now rely on Edifier for all my audio needs!

R46VHPDLJXOW8,B095BV8R27,5.0 out of 5 stars Great product for an amazing price,bakedtater,5,"I'll start off by saying that we're a big headphone/earbud family. My husband works in tech at a big school, and I tutor & do lots of video, music, confrence, etc work. We're also a very big music family & content creating. Sound, is really important to us; as are products. I'd stumbled upon the brand a few years back; and it wasn't long before they'd become one of my(our) preferred brands. We own several of their other headphones & have had EXCEPTIONAL customer service experiences. I was really excited to try these out, as they're similar to another model we have, that's a bit older (although still sounding fantastic & has stood the test of time).These headphones are a great budget headphone- and I used ""budget,"" quite loosely. They have the sound and quaility of a mid grade headphone (comparable to those in the $80-$120 range) and the craftmanship, comfort and look of such as well. While more expensive and luxurious models do have more- well luxury (such as over the ear muffs, that are a bit more cushiony) I dont have any complaints with these. The muffs themselves are very soft, yet firm as you'd want them to be. The plastic doesnt feel cheap; and you do get small little features such as an led indication light by the power button; a toggle switch to swap between bluetooth and noise canceling-which in our vast expeirence doesnt typically come in headphones anywhere near this price range. The packaging is nice, yet simple-you get a usb charger, an audio jack & an easy to read instruction manual. As far as the noise cancelling feature; simply having the headphones in bluetooth mode; immediately deadens sounds- without any auidio playing. As I type this sitting on my patio, I have my music paused and I barely hear the tractor beside our house in the vegetable field. I wouldnt say it's as ""strong"" as their higher end models; and I have a very loud & rowdy 2yo and enthusiastic, energentic ever singing 5yo, and 13yo gamer, to test the limits of those cababilities lol these will definitely drone out the loud theme song of Paw Patrol; barrads of Frozen, and screeching of a teenager slaying shrieking zombies-at least to a very muffled, and intelligible thought processing cability, level lol I do prefer their more elaborate nc headphones for tasks I need to really concentrate on--like critiquing musical composures; or tuning out the tractor or often annoying sounds of my husband putzing around in his paramotor. The headphones also have a metal extension-not plastic; a cushioned top, and the ear muffs swivel both up and down & side to side with ease; and easily excessible volume buttons beside the power button.Hopefully my long winded review gives some better ideas of comparisons and overall daily capabilities. The only reason I don't rate the nc fx 5 stars, is that while it's definitely great and subperb for the price; it is a bit less than higher end models-although I think most would opt for those overall; if that's something they were actually wanting.In conclusion: great headphones, amazing price, awesome customer service, and craftsmanship. These are fantastic headphones for the average person & listening activies. Great for kids too; especially those who can tend to be a bit rough-as kids often are!Update on battery life: I recently took these on a 3 day trip, and our 13yo Alone used them for over 23hrs-I also forgot to power them off and left them on overnight until the next day around noon. It's been a couple days since our trip & I still have yet to have to charge them. Conclusion-Very impressed with the battery life, especially with utilizing the nc for all usage time!!!","Reviewed in the United States August 4, 2021",AFNZKOTGKTU6WZBKGBRTKGRJSGKQ,TRUE,438,Color: Black
R3JUPGR1KT5LXT,B095BV8R27,4.0 out of 5 stars Great general use headphone,Brian Walsh,4,"So I've only had these for a couple of days, but so far a few things I've noticed:Comfort - The padding is quite nice, firmer than my previous pair of noise cancelling headphones (iLive IAHN40) and keep my ears from being pressed flat against my head, the padding on the cans actually cradles the ear and forms a very effective sound barrier to guard against outside noise - I actually forgot I was wearing these for a while when doing some housework with just the noise cancellation feature on. Bonus points for EASILY accessible control buttons. The manual says to charge for 8 hours, but it won't take that long - maybe half that. Came with charger and an Aux chord, which was a nice bonus.Performance - Syncs up to a variety of devices quite easily. So far I've tried my Smartphone, Computer, Firestick and Nintendo Switch and none of them had any difficulty finding and pairing with the new headphones. The audio is crisp and clean, no muffles or distortions with sharper tones. Honestly, I'm a bit blown away by the how well they work given how inexpensive they were to purchase.The only reason I didn't go for 5 stars is because the bass tones aren't as rich as other bluetooth headphones that I've used in the past - they can still throw some bass, but I want to *feel* the low tones, not just hear them.Simply put, they're fantastic - a great general use headphone. If you're on the fence because the price 'seems too good to be true' then this is your sign: take the leap. I've used Beats by Dre, Skull Candy and Bose - except for the minor issue with bass, these headphones keep up with those expensive brands while providing better comfort and affordability.(Note: I do not have Apple products, I tested these headphones with a windows PC and Samsung phone - I'm not sure how/if performance will be impacted when paired with Apple products.)","Reviewed in the United States June 29, 2024",AHATLWRHBL3TSLXKXMYMCUWPATPA,TRUE,41,Color: Black

R1AYMG51STP04I,B095BV8R27,3.0 out of 5 stars As good as they are they could be a lot better,WBJ,3,"These are pretty good in some ways but bad in others and one features is strangely good and bad.The noise cancelling is really good, when I remember to turn it on. I've had 2 other headphones that ANC was a mechanic switch, the upside is that you can enable ANC even with them turned off. The rest have always required the power to be on for ANC to work but they also had ANC on by default.The over all sound quality is pretty good for my use case. I don't use them to listen to music on my phone or some other device. I mostly use it for watching TV/movies and playing games on my PC.The comfort is pretty good. There is one thing I don't like is what happens with my ears. After wearing them for a while there can be bit of discomfort on the back of my ears. Readjusting them can help for a while but it tends to come back. So that's a bit of a star off.The volume control isn't great. Every time I press the up or down controls it might actually adjust the volume or it might not. But speaking of volume every time you turn these on they volume is always reset back to 80%, which if you forget about that can be a real painful reminder. Yet another bit of a star off.Bluetooth syncing this is a strange one. I use a bluetooth transmitter for my TV and PC. So normally I can leave the transmitter on, turn on my previous headphones and it syncs with no issue. But with these, not so much. I have to turn off the transmitter, turn the headphones then turn on the transmitter. If I leave the transmitter on and turn these on, the light on the headphones goes steady as if it's connected to something but the transmitter acts like nothing is connected. I've tried with a different transmitter and I can leave it on, turn on the headphones and it'll sync just fine but that transmitter has other issues I'd rather not go into. So yep, a bit more of a star knocked off which completes the first star off.Now comes the reason for a whole star coming off all on it's own and the most confusing thing I've seen yet; the battery life. These are advertised as 30 hours. I always do two tests; one with ANC on and the other with ANC off. In the past the headphones would say they get 30-40 hours with ANC on and they don't come close, not unless the volume is really low. I won't name brands but one was a $130 well known says 35 hours with ANC, more like 25 hours. Another lesser known brand but listed as 40 hours, best case was 38 hours with the volume half way up. On the other had, these same headphones with ANC off will get 50 and 65 hours, which you would expect. So how do these do? Ready for the confusion? With ANC on the battery got 36 hours. Pretty good right? So why with ANC off does it only get 38 hours? You would think that with ANC off it should be like the other and getting twice the battery life but nope, it don't. I'm just really really confused.Over all for the price these are really good. I also have to admit I'm confused why the ones marked ""Black"" are actually red and so much cheaper (at the time of purchase).","Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2023",AHMHS3WOR4KAL4NW74TKHLKAKNEQ,TRUE,85,Color: Black

And for $30 I have to say I'm impressed.Noise cancelation - The noise cancelation mode is completely useless.Build quality- The build quality is what you would expect from $25-30 headphones. All plastic construction. Buttons feel a little bit cheap.Comfort- Headband is soft, but padding is thin. Ear cups are average quality. They are a bit odd shaped but my large ears just fit. I had no problems wearing headphones for extended periods of time.Fit - I have a big head and these headphones fit well when adjusted 3 clicks from fully extended.Sound- Sound is GREAT. Was really impressed with the overall clarity and clean bass. Was surprised to see that even Austin evens on YouTube said they were the best wireless headphones he had heard for under $50. I have to agree.Range - They advertise like 30 or 35 foot range but mine will go way further. I can go anywhere in my 2,500 sq. ft. home even the basement with zero issues. I have easily been 50 feet from my phone with things like walls interfering and have had zero signal loss.Battery life- Headphones took forever to charge when I first got them. When paired to my phone they showed 90% battery when fully charged? But I have used them for a few weeks now and put a good 5 or 6 hours of use on them and my phone still shows the headphone battery to be at 80%. So battery life seems really good so far.Conclusion - If you can find these headphones on sale, BUY THEM. BUT...I would have to pass on them at their normal $59.99 price.

R2C5T4YP2T4B31,B095BV8R27,5.0 out of 5 stars Most Comfortable Pair I Ever Owned!!,Michelle Slaughter,5,"I have an issue with most OTHER headphones in that usually the headband is not well padded and after wearing them for half an hour the top of my head is sore and I have a headache.THESE are excellent. I've had them for 2 years, and other than the earpads starting to flake, I have not one complaint. They have lots of padding in the headband, I can wear these all day without pain. The cups are equally well padded, AND they are oval instead of round, the same as a human ear.I see people saying they have trouble with charging, but I have no issues, and in fact I can charge these for just half an hour and they go from 40% to 100% in that time. Now, the difference *may* be that I use a magnetic charging cable so I'm not constantly inserting and removing a cord from inside the headphones; with the magnetic cord, I just insert the charging tip and leave it in all the time, then connect the magnetic cable to the charging tip. I discovered a long time ago with frequent insertions of charging cords into my Fire tablet and my phone, this can damage the charging port over time. So all the devices I charge frequently -- earbuds, phone, Fire (omg the Fire will not hold a charge, even though I rarely use it), and headphones -- get a magnetic charging tip inserted and I just connect the cord.That said, I really DON'T have to charge these headphones that often. I wear them most of the day while on my computer and it takes a couple of days for them to get down to 40%. I do connect them to the charging cable most nights just out of pure habit, but if I forget to do so, they aren't going to die on me without warning the next morning.I don't often use the NC function, but that is simply because I haven't found it necessary. Even at low-medium volume, the fit of the headphones makes it so that I can't hear when people are trying to get my attention. I had to even turn my desk 90 degrees so I could see when someone was at my door, because when my back was to it I couldn't hear them. The fact I don't use the NC function may be what gives me such a long battery life, I'm not sure. But so far I have no complaints.I have, after 2 years of use, started to hear a sort of choppiness/popping-low squelching sound when in bluetooth mode, but this may be an issue with my new computer being too close to the wireless router which was an unfortunate necessity of my new setup. It's only with the computer; they still work beautifully with my phone and my tablet.","Reviewed in the United States July 22, 2024",AEZOWXHJJJ54RUPNOFMUNLOQFWRQ,TRUE,0,Color: Black

R21YM74LW39VXG,B095BV8R27,4.0 out of 5 stars Best $40.00 I've Spent,Amazon Customer,4,"I bought these headphones for one reason and one reason only. To keep grass and dust particles out of my ears.What is this guy talking about. I'll tell you. I cut 10 acres of land every week on a zero turn mower, ZTR. I was using noise protection headphones last year to keep my ears clean and this year I decided I needed some music. So I bought these $40 headphones. The description said they are nose cancelling. I said, I'll be the judge of that with a ZTR engine less than two feet away from my ears. Can I still hear the noise from the 725cc engine? Don't be stupid, of course I can, the engine is less than two feet from me. But, with the music playing, the engine noise becomes more like a hum and you forget it is there.Also, I mow in the mornings which means The Bob and Tom Show is on the radio when I start mowing. Today, I heard every word spoken in perfect clarity. These $40 headphones meet and surpass my expectations in sound and comfort. And if they only last a season or two of mowing 10 acres a week, so what, they were only $40.I gave 4 stars only because this is my first set headphones, hey ladies, I'm more of an earbud type of guy, and I have nothing to compare them against. Are the $300 Bose, and I love Bose, noise cancelling headphones 7 1/2 times better than these cheap ($40.) Chinese made headphones? I don't know, but I doubt they are 7 1/2 times better.","Reviewed in the United States March 25, 2024",AFLM4SZTGHIH6MQP3WGRHYIOVZ4A,TRUE,6,Color: Black

Whether I’m commuting or just relaxing at home, these headphones do a fantastic job at blocking out external noise and delivering rich, detailed audio.However, they fall short when it comes to their built-in microphone. I’ve found that during virtual meetings or when trying to dictate commands, the microphone quality isn’t sufficient, which can be frustrating if clear communication is essential.In conclusion, these headphones are excellent for personal listening, particularly if you're looking to enjoy your music without interruptions. But if you need a reliable microphone for meetings or dictations, you might want to consider other options.

R2P1796RR0TVGK,B095BV8R27,4.0 out of 5 stars For the warranty (EDITED: around 3 months of usage),Lucy Sue,4,"TLDR:-Sound: good for the price, in terms of ranges it's nothing that adjusting the equalizer can't fix, minimal sound leakage (avoid Loud volumes, but mid-high should be fine.)-noise canceling may as well not be there at all-fit: good on a smaller person, will slip right off when working out but otherwise stay on with a little slippage-charging: what's expected. Nothing super long or super short.Sound: good for the price but don't expect anything mind blowing, but it's still good. Compared to the Bose QuietComfort 35s I personally prefer the sound these have. Partially because I edited my equalizer on my phone settings, but even then I found that these have a slightly clearer sound. Sound leakage is minor but exists slightly. Just don't blast your music at full volume when close to people and you'll be fine, but at a Quiet setting on spotify you should be fine a couple levels past half up.-heavier drums tend to be a little crispy-bass isn't too high or too low-vocals are fine generally-mid-tones can be a tad crispy if particularly loud in a songNoise canceling: basically non-existent. The ANC just adds a slight white noise that only slightly masks noisy surroundings. I found that it also just barely affects the volume of the music, but it's little enough that it really makes no difference.Comfort/Fit: They fit fine for me. However, I'm also a smaller person so the ear pads fit over my ears without squishing them at all. However, you really cannot work out with them. They slip right off if you tilt your head back/forward.Battery/charging: it's certainly not super long, but if you don't use them solely bluetooth 24/7 you'll be fine. The cord works great if you want to save Battery. Charging takes around 45 minutes- 1 hour? I haven't used them until 0% yet but from 50/60% it took around 30-40 minutes to charge to 100%.","Reviewed in the United States October 10, 2023",AGGSJITYN2XFMNWTYW44O4J6Y6KQ,TRUE,14,

RJ590GRX2COVI,B095BV8R27,"4.0 out of 5 stars Very nice, light weight adjustable headphones",Nona of 8,4,"Usually when I review a product I start by saying what I like about the item then if there are any draw backs but this time because there are just, in my opinion 2 small ones I would like to start with those. First being they are not very noise canceling. I have had other head phones, far cheaper that were better at that. But because I have a 70+ yr old husband who watches TV while I watch a movie or YouTube by him and want to be able to hear if he is talking to me or calling me, if the phone rings etc. these enable me to do that. So in a way that for me is a plus for others most likely not. 2nd I found that at times while these are holding on my ears because they are at the smallest configuration, the top part where it comes to hold onto your head starts to slip. If you look at the picture it doesn’t seem as though they are too big but I would say as a grown woman with an average size head I would think, these are not for teens unless on the larger size or males and they do open quite large.Now as to the positives I personally found. The sound I feel is on par with the high quality BEATS that I have tried out in the stores. Obviously not the noise canceling part but the sound is such that you hear every note crisply and the notes are not lost in the base or over ridden by any other noise. It’s a very crisp sound and I was very impressed once again with how for such a low price point this item could bring such a good product to the table.The ear muffs are plentiful and very soft. I am in my 60’s, a child of the 60’s, 70’s etc. so these are the headphones we used. I have had more pairs of headphones than I can count. These are really up there with the best. Comfort for long listening, long listening time is just a quick charge away and easy paring Just go to settings, blue tooth, press the left side of the headphones where there is a button that sticks out. It will then say, Power on, then you’ll see an E7 and then it will say connected. Sometimes you have to touch the E7 to have it pare. *Note if you have other accessories connected if you are using these with say an iPad or some other such device, just know that if you have a keyboard pared with it you may have to un-pare it and then re-pare these headphones.","Reviewed in the United States March 31, 2023",AECSAIUA6MIBVHOU4NRYHAFLWLBA,TRUE,114,Color: Black

I've gotten Bluetooth headphones in this price range from other brands before and I'm happy but not impressed with these. The sound quality is mildly worse then I'm used to and the part that sits on my head is a little slippery, which often causes them to fall off when I pull an ear back to talk to someone. They're quite fashionable though and seem sturdy.UPDATE:When using these to talk over the phone, my voice is muffled. I don't think this was always the case, people started mentioning it to me a few weeks ago. It hasn't even been a year since I got these headphones. In better news, I stopped having the issue of the headphones sliding off when I pull an ear back. Not sure if that's because wear and tear has caused them to be less slippery or if I've changed how I'm pulling them back. Also at this point I think I can safely say they are comfortable for all-day wear. I wear my headphones at work, at home, on walks, most of my day basically. They make my ears a little sweaty in the summer and keep my ears warm in the winter. I find wearing headphones helps me feel calm even when I'm not listening to anything, so I wind up wearing them even in the heat.","Reviewed in the United States November 2, 2023",AH6CIC4EAIR6XMOWSER427BWNBXQ,TRUE,1,Color: Black

R23C7XJWC3GV6A,B095BV8R27,4.0 out of 5 stars Very good for under 40$!,Xe🫀,4,"I've had these headphones for a few months now, so I can properly give my honest review. I'll rate this off of a few things: Comfort, ""Noise Cancelling"", Sound, Battery, and Hold.For starters, these are very soft (but loose) headphones. Because they're loose, it's comfortable. It doesn't hurt my ears, and I'm a person who has spikey earrings. I wore these all throughout a road trip I took. Never hurt my ears once. I even slept in them because my brother was snoring in our hotel, and it cancelled it out quite well!That takes us to the ""noise cancelling"" feature. It's cool, but it's really not that good. It doesn't cancel at all. It muffles sounds around you from far away, but up close you can still hear others speaking with you, which is a nice feature in busy rooms for those with auditory processing issues! This feature can be navigated by pressing the on button once, to where you'll hear a voice say ""AFC on"" and ""AFC off to listen to regular music again.The sound is surprisingly good, and it's held up just as well for the 5 months I've own these. They get fairly loud actually, and the quality is good! Suits my tastes. However, if you listen to it too loud the sound does leak.The battery life however is scarily good. It hasn't drained that much, like a phone does over time, and the battery gets worse, y'know? Thes have held up well. I wouldn't be surprised if it's more like 60 hours of battery life. On my 9 day road trip, I only had to charge for small amounts like once or twice... and I would be sitting with my headphones on in the car for 9 hours a time sometimes. I use them every day before school, within my first 90 minute period, and through the day, and on the way home. Every day. For a week. And by the end of the week, they're still at 60% battery! It's amazing. Airpods could seriously never, or Lunexpods which I've also tried. Never seen a better battery life.With all of these nice features, they feel fragile when I hold them. I have a bad habit of breaking things, though. I haven't broken these yet! They still feel like they'll break, though... Thin headband. And the ear parts rotate and they feel like they'll fall off. 5 months strong still, baby!Okay, I hope this was helpful!! I couldn't recommend these more, still. I love them! and they're stylish at least to me. Cause I wear a lot of black and red, they match.","Reviewed in the United States December 17, 2022",AFQ3MLKJKOK726LKQUZQ3AWTNKOQ,TRUE,128,Color: Black

Pretty comfortable, but most importantly, the audio quality is great; it's not grainy at all. Overall, it has great audio quality in general for headsets. I would give the quality an 8.5 out of 10.As far as price goes; although the red and black headset is cheaper, the only difference is literally the color, so if you're on a budget, the red and black one is a good choice.The only problem is that, if you forget to charge your headset one day, you can't simply plug it into your computer with a cord. It has to be charged, no matter which way you use it, whether it's with Bluetooth or with a cord. As someone with a short attention span and often forgets to plug things in, this has been very frustrating on most days, but I only have myself to blame.Still a fantastic headset though, and has lasted me a long time. Good product choice if you're looking for something cheap that will last and carry great quality.","Reviewed in the United States December 2, 2023",AHR2TQY6XBDQ7GF2ODWWCWF5LBMQ,TRUE,14,Color: Ture Black

RXANWRB2T59A1,B095BV8R27,4.0 out of 5 stars It’s OK for the $$$…,Robin & Doc,4,"The product arrived on time and in working order.Though it doesn’t make any difference, I just thought it was strange that they call the product color “black”; the red is ok and all, but… 🤷🏼‍♂️ 😏The noise cancellation works well. I’m glad that they’ve started putting in the “C” connector plug on these cheaper models; it just makes it really easy to find the charging port - and that means less fiddle-farting around if it’s in a darker room.Now- as to the unit holding a “30 hour charge” after it’s topped off- mine doesn’t come close. I don’t play anything at “full-ape” volume, nor do I leave the headphones on when not in use so the best I’ve done with this is 22 hrs, 36 minutes. 🤷🏼‍♂️ That’s a tad irritating. The sound quality is “OK”, but nothing to write home about.The sliding headband to fit your head seems somewhat loose, but I’ll deal with it. The built-in mic picks up well on calls, and the controls are easy enough to learn and use either off or on your head. Sometimes it’s a little difficult to get it to turn off, but again I’ll deal with it.","Reviewed in the United States November 22, 2023",AGCMUNBZ6J5NBFSRPPHNSIK5PEYQ,TRUE,1,Color: Black
R227O36DLL63X5,B095BV8R27,4.0 out of 5 stars First headset review,Jerry Nesseler,4,"The headsets are attractive. Bright red. Arrived quickly and packed perfect. They connected fast and easy and we’re even charged. So. Today I wore to gym to exercise. One thing I’ve not read is that they fall down off the head if leaning forward, or back. They are pretty comfortable and my head did not feel squeezed. But I would like them to stay in place. I’ll keep trying to figure out the right spot, but just a little forward of my crown and down push ups makes them fall forward. Just a little back and they fall back doing heavy pull downs. And. They kind of get in the way doing anything over the head. Hanging from a bar doing knees to chest or toes to bar, they get in the way. And my arms up by the headset causes intermittent Bluetooth interference. My phone was on the floor next to me. But. Not a big deal. As I said. They were comfortable. But I’ve not had anything like this. Well, excluding the 1970’s big ole headsets of the day. Totally different. Anyway, the sound was good. I did not have to crank it all the way. But. I could still hear the music and people around me. I pushed the nc button. Not sure if I did it correctly but I don’t think it made a difference. Overall I like them. I’m not sure if all brands sacrifice the right squeeze to stay in place versus the possibility of the headset falling down forward/ back. Other brands look like the actual ear muff is larger, I’m not sure that’s better. The price was a lot better than most. So overall. I’m glad these were the ones I chose.","Reviewed in the United States July 28, 2023",AEB3ZYKEXHHUZLNL3QDUWZMEQ3FQ,TRUE,42,Color: Black

R19MZSI9NOKZP9,B095BV8R27,"5.0 out of 5 stars Pretty good in general, perfect for what I needed",Reverend J,5,"TLDR: sound is pretty good but bass is mushy, not enough highs, noise canceling is ok, volume is plenty loudI had a very specific use in mind, and these headphones are perfect. I do woodworking, and I like to listen to audio books while I work. Unfortunately, regular headphones are drowned out by the constantly running shop-vac and assorted tools. I’m concerned if I turn up the volume loud enough to hear what’s being said over the noise I’ll blow out my hearing.So, after hearing my ex-wife brag about the sound cancelling abilities of her air pods, I decided to give the tech a go. My guess is the noise canceling on these headphones isn’t anywhere near as good as the apple pods, but they also aren’t several hundred dollars. And frankly, I don’t want them to be that quiet - the last thing I need is to forget that the table saw is running. With these headphones, I get: reduced volume from the tools, which is better for my ears, decent enough clarity in sound for audio books, and I can hear the narrator without having to turn up the volume, even when running my Dewalt lunchbox planer that sounds like a jet taking off.I don’t like the sound for music - too bassy, which normally I love, but this bass is pretty mushy. But again - in this price range I give them 5 stars.UPDATE: I’ve been wearing these for a week or so now, and I’ll add a couple of points:They are very comfortable. With my other headsets I usually have to remove them after a couple of hours because they hurt my ears. I leave these on all day.I tested the active noise cancellation against the fan in my bathroom (never mind why I had them on in the bathroom, shut up) and what I found is that turning the ANC on in no way diminishes the volume of the fan, it just sucks the bass end out, probably storing it up to make songs sound mushy later. I think that’s why it works well for me, as most of my tools (e.g. my Ridgid shop vac) operate in that lower register.","Reviewed in the United States March 30, 2023",AGI5MXWM3FV2BRLIIEHSLZXBC6SQ,TRUE,29,Color: Black

The first couple hours I wore these gave me a pretty bad headache, but as I use them more the band is loosening. And there is one little thing I don’t like. When you hit max volume, the headset will pause whatever you’re listening to to tell you it’s at max volume.

In my case these phones punched above their weight in the categories that matter - comfort, sound, ease-of-use, and compatibility. I've used them with Apple and Android phones and tablets, and with a few brands of stereo equipment, with no pairing issues. The sound is better than you'd imagine at this price point (but don't be expecting Abyss or Focal). And the level of comfort is also a nice surprise, as budget phones frequently skimp on padding for the earcups and the top-of-head. I haven't tried the noise cancellation as I use them in a residence, and there's nothing to cancel :-). If it's time to replace your inexpensive Bluetooth phones because they're no longer rechargeable or have fallen once too many times, the E7 will be great. And if you go this route, check out the matching travel case elsewhere on Amazon - it fits perfectly and will protect the E7 if you pack it in your luggage.","Reviewed in the United States April 2, 2024",AGT6IWSWJGPLWICNN4QLI65HMARQ,TRUE,11,Color: Black

I hooked the headset up to the cable I use for my phones and quick charging. It works great for that. But the headset did not charge. I would turn them on and the phone would connect and say 30%. Drop to 20% in about 3-4 seconds. And then as soon as I started music phone would indicate 10% charge and then the headset would just power off due to no charge. I was going to return. But then I grabbed the cable that came with the phone. Hooked it to the low powered USB port on my charger and it began charging. It ended up charging fine but took a while to do it. Seems it is not compatible with fast charging ports or blocks. Cable I was using is fine and works with everything else so switching to a lower power usb port was the only difference.The headband seems sturdy as well.

R1W79PY7NVIVP0,B08WR6YDKP,5.0 out of 5 stars I'm really enjoying and liking this pair of headphones,stickman,5,"I absolutely didn't need a pair of headphones having many already to choose from but I really wanted a pair of ANC on ear headphones and the selection with ANC is pretty slim. So when the live 460nc went on sale, I decided to give them a go.As expected, the cans are much smaller than over the ear headphones and since they do fold up, they'll do very well on the go. That was the main reason for the purchase. I have a pair of over the ear cans (Anker Soundcore Q45) but I wanted something that would be smaller to travel with on airplanes. The ANC would be to help drown out the engine noise. As you can see in the pictures, they fold down nicely for storage.What I didn't know about was how well they integrate with Google Assistant. I'm still trying to figure this out but when I paired them to my phone, it actually asked me to download the companion app which I did. Through the app, I can change the equalizer and some other features that I have yet to fully explore. But I was rather surprised that it did things my pixel buds do. It'll read your messages by double tapping the left can or you can press and hold the left can and use assistant to do things. I'm still working on all the things I can do right from the headphones.The button controls are entirely on the right can and the charging port is on the left one. I don't think the right can has a touch feature like the left can does. There is a 2.5mm jack on the right can.The headband padding isn't very substantial but at the same time, I don't find these uncomfortable. They're quite comfy in fact. They won't be as comfy as the Anker over the ear but I don't think there will be a problem wearing these for hours. I've only tested them around the house for an hour at most and I got use to wearing them quite quickly. And, i have a big head. They didn't feel like they were squishing my head, something that is very very important.So far, I've only played audiobooks and a few songs from it but I've been pleased with what I'm hearing so far. But I'm also not very picky. So long as the ANC works well and I get good enough sound and it's comfy, I'm satisfied. I'll be testing these in a couple of months on a cross country flight. That will be a real test...5 hours on a plane. I'll update after that flight.Pro: CompactComfy for on the earANCGoogle assistant integrationSimple controlsCons: ANC not quite as good as over ear but that's expected.Not as comfy as over ear but again, as expected.Truthfully, if you have reasonable expectations on these I think you won't be disappointed. They're a solid mid range pair of headphones from a very good reputable company and they dish out good sound. I'll have my son test them the next time he comes back from school. He'll be a lot better at assessing the sound quality. In my eyes though, these are a great purchase for the purpose I got them for...travel.Update: Took them on my recent trip and used them for hours on the plane. The return flight was a 6 hr direct flight and I had them on the entire trip with no problems. I watched movies through the entire flight and didn't have any issues hearing the audio from the movies. I think there is better ANC in other headphones but that's also a factor of the design. I don't expect to get ANC that's better than over the ear headphones. But the comfort level was much better than i thought. I didn't run hot which I often do with other on ear or over the ear headphones. These were very comfortable for the flight.I didn't charge them after the flight there or back. I still have 70% life left according to my phone. So after 12 hours of use during flights to and from, I've still got 70%. That to me is really good.For the price you can get these for, I think they're great. I doubt they'll match up to anything like the Sony 1000XM-4 or 5s but they're also 1/3 the price on sale.","Reviewed in the United States October 13, 2023",AEC37Q7TYBZXLBMMZMFUNKV4L3OQ,TRUE,42,Color: Blue

Also, they don’t take long to recharge at all!• Connectivity and Control- I’ve had no issues with Bluetooth pairing and the headphones' controls, including physical buttons/touch controls, and app-based controls are easy to follow and use.CONS:• Noise Cancelling: Effectively blocks out noise as long as it’s not too loud, so they’re great for use at the office. Also includes features such as ambient aware on the app. Nevertheless, the noise cancelling feature leaves a little more desired. For example, if the external noise is too loud, there is a noticeable hissing sound.All that said, I’m glad I purchased these headphones! I’ll update my review as time goes by.","Reviewed in the United States March 24, 2023",AHRG63XGMD3VRCGLHKEOTSTJGB5A,TRUE,11,Color: Black

The battery life is incredible, I think they have only died once or twice on me the entire time I've had them. They can easily last many days in a row. The sound quality and noise cancelling were both good, nothing to complain about.The only thing that was immidiately annoying was the some of the features the headphones have. It can pause and play music automatically whenever you put it on or take it off. I didn't want to use that feature, so I turned it off in the app. However, it still makes a little 'bee dee boop' whenever you put the headphones on or off. Unfortunately, the detection isn't great, especially when lying down or with one side off your ear, so it repeately makes that noise without being able to see any way to turn that off.That was annoying, but okay to live with. However, with all three pairs that I've bought of this, within a month or two, every single one had at least one earpad break and at least some buttons fail to work. The fabric of the earpad doesn't get connected well to the foam, so it comes off over time and blocks the drivers. Eventually it comes off altogether and you need to replace the earpads. Even worse than this is that the buttons, especially volume up, volume down, and play/pause. These worked fine at first, but then they seized up a month or two into use and stop working. I've tried pressing them hard or in different directions, but none of these buttons work on any pair I have.","Reviewed in the United States December 17, 2023",AG6YWLDIFFSOSPGZWAMMNOCQ5YRQ,TRUE,5,Color: Black

Additionally, they're comparatively lightweight unlike the other over-the-ear ""gym headphones"" that are heavy and fall off your head during workouts.-USB-C charging makes charging easy if you already have USB-C devices around the houseCONS:-The play and volume button is already broken. This was disappointing as one of the main reasons I bought these were so that I can keep my phone in my pocket at the gym. Now I have to pull out my phone every time I want to change the volume or when it auto pauses and I want to press play again (see below)-The auto play/pause function is way too sensitive and incredibly annoying! A slight tilt or turn of the head can activate it and stop your music randomly. On some days, it feels like it's got a mind of its own.Overall would buy again but for the right price ($50 or lower).

Switching from phone to laptop takes 45 literal seconds. For some reason, the headphones need to stop dead for a period, then ""turn on"" from an already-on state, test out the noise-canceling, then announce that it's ready to pair, at which point I have to tell my laptop to connect (which I already did; this prompted the described preparation process from the headphones). Overall, it is less capable at remembering my devices and connecting right away than other, cheaper headphones.Sound is fine. It's fine. I bought these to replace $35 Skullcandy bluetooth headphones, and it's about on par. Nothing stands out as bad, but these cost a lot more than the Skullcandys and I don't perceive a difference in quality.Noise Canceling is ok. I can appreciate the differences between settings, and I can accept that maybe I'm just not the right person for the feature.","Reviewed in the United States January 28, 2023",AFJ46HSKECFQUI7H7KDKNVSGFKMA,TRUE,3,Color: Black

Also, it keeps shutting off every so often and makes the sound that it's shutting down but it doesn't shut down. I can be listening to a song or watching a movie and it just shuts down for no reason. I have tried to download and update the software but it keeps saying that my software is up to date. I've tried some other troubleshooting but still does not work. Unfortunately, I cannot give this product a high rating due to it just being a year and already acting up. Pretty sad I normally like JBL products.

They are great quality, great sound, and with some adjustments, it's the most comfortable headset out of all the ones I bought which is ultimately why I kept these ones.The problem i have with headsets over the ear is that my ears get hot very fast, and that's mostly because the headsets apply a lot of pressure to my ears. What's unique about this headset is that they are VERY FLEXIBLE. I literally stretched them all the way backward without breaking so that they are not as tight and got them to be just right as far as comfort.these would be great for people with larger heads.if you're not worried about comfort as much, then I'd recommend the Skullcandy Riff 2 which are cheaper and are great quality.","Reviewed in the United States August 31, 2023",AE5QAE5AX333M4KQL2NHDH6XO6PQ,TRUE,22,Color: Black

I used them for a while, and I was looking for headphones that are small, not huge or bulky. These are nice and small but I have a a couple ear piercings and these headphones caused some pain. They squished my ears a bit and made them uncomfortable. The features that I did like on these were the nice ambient sound that plays when you have the headphones in but aren’t playing anything, it’s like nature sounds and it’s nice and calming. I used these for runs and when there was some wind or a breeze it would go right through the headphones and I wouldn’t be able to hear the music. if I didn’t crank up the volume I would just hear the headphones kinda rattling against my ear & piercings. I really tried to like these because they’re nice & small & pairing them was really easy, however the noise cancellation is not that great. I took these to the gym and I could hear a lot of noise around me, so again I had to crank up the volume to flush out the noise. Compared to my AirPods Pro, the noise cancellation was a bit weak. Noise cancellation is really important for me as I’ll be wearing these to the gym and on the airplane, where I don’t want to hear anything but silence or my own audio. If noise cancellation isn’t too big of a concern for you then I recommend these but not if you have piercings like I do.","Reviewed in the United States February 9, 2023",AFHVF2E2LJ6PUICWKW2UMHF2PNHA,TRUE,5,Color: Black

R2X0JM5S7SLRXL,B08WR6YDKP,3.0 out of 5 stars These Have One Major Flaw! Details Given In The Review.,Black Guppy,3,"In case this applies to the way that YOU use headphones, you should know about this flaw. I own TWO pair of these, along with 4 pair of other headphones, so I'm able to compare these JBL's with one another, and with all of the others that I own. Also, BOTH of the JBL's have the same problem, so apparently, I'm not dealing with a ""fluke"" that only applies to one pair that came defective from the factory. The phones are nice, and I enjoy using them INSIDE my home. However, I cannot use them anywhere that there is more than a ""whisper"" of wind. As soon as any breeze blows over the phones, I hear horrible, loud noise in my ears, which almost hurts. I don't understand exactly what is happening, but it ""feels and sounds"" as though the wind sound is somehow being ""amplified"" by the headphones. Ouch! I'm guessing that this problem is related to the noise cancellation feature. I WANT TO BE PERFECTLY CLEAR that I'm talking about listening to recorded music or podcasts -- NOT talking on the phone -- so there is no microphone involved. On every occasion that I've taken these outdoors, I've given up after a few good ""blasts"" to my ears, then carried them with me during the rest of my walk. The wind was NOT severe... just the usual breezes. And when this occurs, I'm walking, not running. So I'm not increasing the wind speed by running into the wind. I do not have this problem with any of my other 4 pair of headphones, regardless of the brand. Even the $29.00 ones are quiet when the wind blows on them. I hope this is helpful information for those who desire to use their new headphones outdoors.","Reviewed in the United States April 27, 2022",AGDORT4RG54XPTVMRBXCKHFJDCXQ,TRUE,4,Color: Black

If you adjust the headphones on your ear, it will stop the music. If you run, the bouncing can mess up with the sensor too. So, to me it's a totally useless feature and I deactivated it.I tested it in a conference, audio and mic work well. You can't speak softly tho otherwise the mic won't pick up.My main complaint is it is as hard as a piece of wood.Do you wear glasses? Forget it. It's impossible to wear this headphones with glasses.

R3325U4HJSBBN9,B08WR6YDKP,1.0 out of 5 stars Overpriced and Underwhemling!,MRB,1,"For the price, and the well-known brand, I expected these headphones to impress. At first, was impressed, but I quickly learned that every good thing about these headphones also has a downside.For example... the sound quality is nice enough, but I don't particularly notice a difference in quality between these and my previous, $15 bluetooth headphones from a generic brand. And, while you can remix the sound via the app, it really isn't worth remixing the levels constantly for every different song/genre you listen to, which is the only way I ended up being able to hear a distinct difference.Additionally, it is very frustrating and annoying that the functionality of these headphones is controlled only via an app. While the headphones are arguably usable out of the box, if you want to adjust the levels, or set up the voice assistant, or do anything more complex than simply connect to a device with bluetooth, you have to download the app and allow it location-track your headphones.I was also frustrated that the headphones did not come equipped with a standard 3.5mm headphone jack. While a cord was provided, the connecting hole on the headphones was much smaller than standard, so if the provided cord ever breaks, I will have to pay out of pocket to replace it.However the worst thing about these headphones is the auto-pause function. It is supposed to pause your music for you when you take the headphones off, however, what ends up actually happening is that every time you make a small motion with you head, or you stand up, or sit down, it beeps and pauses the music. Essentially, unless you sit stiff as a board while listening, it will pause. And there is no way to disable the sensor that makes it do this. Through, of course, the app, you can turn the setting off, however the sensor is still active, so it will click and beep every time you move, it just doesn't pause the music. And it is loud, and annoying, the volume of the beeps doesn't seem to change as you adjust the volume of the headphones.The only feature of these headphones that I couldn't find an issue with was the battery life. They have decent battery life, and even charge fairly quickly.If these were ten or even twenty dollar headphones, I might be more impressed, more willing to work with the issues they have, however, for what I paid (about $70), and what they're currently listed for (about $100), I would definitely advise you to spend your money elsewhere.","Reviewed in the United States January 29, 2023",AH7TAIQMX4VHZXZQTJX3YYV7T62A,TRUE,21,Color: Black

(1) Too many buttons with similar feel on the on the edge of the right headphone make it hard to quickly, intuitively find the right button to due what you want to do. (2) sound cancellation doesn't work right in breezy conditions. The sound of air movement is accentuated to a higher pitch. The button to turn off the cancellation requires two pushes to do it, but they have to be timed just right with an interval between pushes. (3) The battery life is good, but the headphones don't audibly advise battery level when you turn them on or off so you still run the risk of unexpectedly running out of power when out and about. The only way to know the battery level is in the app and even then it's a number in very small type, maybe hard to see for some people, and isn't labelled. You must turn on the headphones before the app can work. (4) You can't use the Google Assistant if you're wearing a hood or anything else that brushes against the headphones as it triggers Assistant and cuts off whatever you want to listen to.

I am not an expert, but this is the best sound I have ever heard and I am loving being able to turn up the volume. I wear glasses and id did take me a minute to discover how to wear them comfortably.

Also, the battery life is phenomenal I use them every day and only charge them once a week. On the down side these set on top of the ears so if they aren't setting just right they allow a little extra background noise in.

R183FUGM0PLV2I,B083W7V3RG,"5.0 out of 5 stars a Well built headphone with Top notch ANC, Call quality and Sound quality.",Jeff Casperson,5,"The sennheiser HD450 BT is the successor to the 4.50. it's an improvement in every way.Comfort.The 450 BT has a thin headband but it never dug into my head at all. This is all plastic but it's well constructed and folds to a very compact size. The one thing i wish is that the earcups were a smidge wider, but i can think of a number of people i know and who i had try these headphones on, of varrying builds and none of them felt comfort was an issue. Truthfully it isn't anything i can't live with and i am nitpicking, but also comparing to other headphones i own.The headphones charge via USB-C and also have an analog cable with a 2.5 MM plug for the headphones, and a 3.5 MM for your headphone jack.The codecs they support are SBC, AAC, APTX and APTX-LL. The latter is designed to sync the audio from a TV or movie with what you see on screen.Note; IPHONES AND IPADS DO NOT SUPPORT THIS FEATURE.noise canceling. The headphones do well illiminating the whirring from AC units, busses etc, but with Air Conditioners for example, you'll still hear the fan noise, though it will be reduced. These also don't block voices very well, though they passively block them out enough so that with music playing at low-medium volumes and higher of course, you likely won't hear any of these noises well. There are headphones that cost double who's ANC is not as good as the Sennheiser HD450 BT.Sound. You can customize the sound via the Sennheiser Smart Control app, available on IOS and Android, via a dot EQ. The eq implementation is 2 stars only because i am able to get a sound i enjoy with these and other Sennheiser products i have which also use the Smart Control app, but from a programming and customization standpoint, it earns a solid half a star.By default the sound has an emphasis on bass in all it's forms, but these are not muddy by any means. The mids are full and the treble is rolled off slightly, but fortunately all this can be refined to some degree with the eq. Theres still a veil to the sound if i compare them to higher priced models like the NAD Viso HP70 or Shure Aonic 50, but those cost twice as much as the $200 MSRP Sennheiser placed on these. that said, these have some real potential and if you use an app that has a multiband eq, you could really make these shine. AS is, they have a good sense of space for instruments to have separation and sounds in tv shows to have their place as well.Functionality.The Sennheiser 450 BT uses buttons for it's functions.on the underside of the left side of the headphone just above the earcup, there is a braille L to indicate left. The right earcup is where all the buttons and ports are.you have the analog adapter mentioned earlier, the USB-C port, on the bottom edge of the right earcup. The volume button has a dot on one end, that's volume up. the other side closest to you while wearing them is volume down. Details like this help when you want to use them without looking, especially because while the buttons aren't hard to use, they are a little cramped in some instances. Fortunately they're distinct enough that it shouldn't be hard memorizing each one and what it does. Back to the layout, the next button over from volume moving towards your ear while you're wearing them is a toggle which rewinds and fastforwards by flicking it it up for fast forward, and down for rewind. Fun fact, if you hold the toggle in either direction, you can scrub through the track bit by bit. perfect if you miss something while listening to a podcast or audiobook. some devices and apps don't support this functionality however. pressing inward on the toggle pauses or plays music and also answers and ends calls. next button up, right near where the headphone band connects to the earcup is an assistent button. This worked 100% of the time. I didn't need to set it up like i have to with some products. This is using google Assistent. on the opposite side of the right earcup from the assistent button is the power/noise cancelation button. You press and release to turn ANC on and off and hold for 2-3 seconds to power on and off. Hold for 5 seconds to place in pairing mode.These also support multipoint connection, so you can have them connected to a tablet for music and a phone for calls for example. If you have music playing on one device, and recieve a call on another device the headphones are paired to, the music will pause, and the call will come in. you can hold the function button for a couple of seconds to reject the call. IF you do, your audio from the previous device will start playing again.Call quality. While these headphones don't have a transparency mode available while listening to music etc, they do use it for phone calls. This is a wonderful feature because you can clearly hear yourself and your environment while on a call. Vital while you're walking or might otherwise be occupied. The callers i spoke with in most cases didn't know beforehand i was using headphones for the call. And they never ask me to repeat myself or if i were on bluetooth. while speaking with them i did every day tasks, washing dishes, talking with my birds, vacuuming etc. The people i did ask for feedback on how i sounded said they could hear these noises in the background, but the sounds didn't overpower my voice and they could always hear me clearly. I left my phone in a room most the time while i wandered through my apartment and it never cut out on the call or while listening to music.These are a fantastic buy. If you want a well built headphone that has a lot of features but doesn't have a premium price, this is the one to get right now.","Reviewed in the United States July 28, 2020",AEJE3YYJADW4FF6VI4SVPAG3SIQQ,TRUE,161,Style: OriginalColor: Black
R35663HRU285DG,B083W7V3RG,5.0 out of 5 stars Updated Review: Still Sound Great!!!,SomeGuy,5,"2 Years one month!Finally one of the padded earcups has a tear and the foam is showing. I can't feel the difference but I will but a new set of replacement cups for $10 - $15. Maybe they'd last longer if I wiped them down sometimes?They still work like the day I got them. I use them every day.2 Year Review Update!Still going strong! Still hold a great charge, no connection issues. I use them every night for several hours.No damage, all the buttons work, the padding is fine, no tears or wear. They look and operate like brand new. I love these things.If you can get them for around $100 or so do not hesitate.Updated Review #5 3/12/2022Still great! No issues whatsoever. Price is currently $129, I'd do it at that price. No disconnections. Noise cancellation makes my window fan almost silent while not noticeably affecting sound quality. Can't hear the roommates. I'm in my own world with these on.I use these for watching videos on a PC where I can EQ and raise the volume more than someone with a phone. I use them on my phone too, but my audio player has a way to boost the sound so that I can play them extra loud if I want to.Updated Review #4 11/10/2021Still working great after almost a year now, still comfortable. Still 5 stars. I use them every night for several hours. Still holds a long charge.Updated Review #3 5/27/2021Still working great, I love these things. Paid a little less than $100. Holds a charge great. Never drops the signal. Ever. I use them every night to watch movies and they're fantastic.I am no longer bothered by the ear cups no matter how I wear them. Maybe they softened up a little. These are bad ass!Updated Review #2 1/29/2021Okay I got these headphones to fit comfortably. I hope I can explain this. Back to 5-stars.I put the headphones on, then I swivel the cups forward, like putting more pressure near my temple (front of the ear), and less pressure on the back part of the ear (that sticks out from my head).The mistake is trying to fit them evenly over my ear, or flat against my head. At least for me. The cups are simply too small (they should be bigger!). Making this adjustment makes them fine for hours. I have no discomfort and the sound quality is not changed at all.I still think the narrow ear design is flawed (I believe I said ""stupid"" earlier), but the sound quality and price I paid keep these at 5 stars.And I repeat, for better and louder sound on a PC, I recommend the FREE ""Equalizer APO"". It EQ's all sounds coming from your computer to the headphones and speakers. Also download another free program called ""Peace"" to control the EQ easier. Way easier.Updated Review 1/19/2021These are uncomfortable after prolonged use. I can watch a movie, but after that it is sometimes a bit painful. The ear pads are poorly designed and I am looking to replace them. They are too narrow, I really don't understand why they were designed this way.Just looking at them tells you they are not made to fit over the ear of a human being. I just don't see how you can screw up that part of a headphone design. It's dumb.I paid $99 for these less than two months ago, now they are $146. If I'd paid $146 I would definitely return them, but for the price I paid I'm hoping I can find better ear pads instead. They sound great and I like everything else about them.I also may have found a way of positioning them so that they are more comfortable, but seriously why should I have to? I shouldn't even know I'm wearing them after a few minutes. What a stupid design.-------------------------This is my first pair of wireless headphones and I am very happy with them.They sound so much better than the cheap wired ones I usually get, and I used to think they were pretty good! I didn't know what I was missing before. Now I can re-watch some movies with incredible sound!I can see why some people will find the ear cup padding uncomfortable. I may end up replacing them, but if I adjust them over my ears right then I really don't have any problems. They could be a little wider though and I do have to move them a little sometimes. This is the only issue that could remove a star from my review, but like I said, so far I'm fine with it so all stars are intact.The sound is very clear and they do a good job covering the entire frequency range. I use Equalizer APO for my Windows machine, so whatever I run through the speakers or headphones is custom EQd. That makes a giant difference!The battery life kicks butt! They last so long I forget to recharge them. it's just not something I have to do very often :)For the first few weeks I could hit the center of the volume ""rocker"" button and it would tell me how much battery life I had left. I can't get that to work anymore. No biggie though. It will warn me if there is less than 12 hours left anyways when I turn them on.The noise cancellation works well. But really the full cup nature of these headphones deal with most noise without the need of electronics. If I wear these with no sound playing I can't hear much in the way of noise.I could do without the button that handles the track skipping and pausing. I sometimes hit it instead of the volume by mistake and my movie starts over from the beginning. I use a mouse for that stuff so I don't need it. I just take an extra moment to make sure I don't do that. Maybe I can put some tape over it. A lot of people like this feature so I'm probably in the minority.I paid about $99 for these and I am very happy. They could be louder on the phone though, but my music app has a volume boost that I can use. On the PC I can make them as loud as I want.I love not tripping over the wire of my old headphones anymore, or rolling over the wire with my chair. Such an annoyance! Wireless is awesome!The sound quality is very good. Wireless headphones downsample the audio before streaming to your ears, but with these I can't tell. They are also HD in that regard - they transmit a higher quality sound. And if you're really picky you can plug them in with the cord and get full sound. I can't tell the difference.I had to buy a Bluetooth adapter so I got one here at Amazon. get Bluetooth 5! I had an issue getting all this to work, but once I figured it out they work great.I did a ton of research before buying these. I look forward to watching movies and listening to music more now. I highly recommend them, they are awesome!","Reviewed in the United States January 6, 2021",AH7XQNMHVYFCQTHQXXJ4CCVKIQNA,TRUE,393,Style: OriginalColor: Black
R2DPR2U3ZWRJ1H,B083W7V3RG,4.0 out of 5 stars Great Headphones for The Price!!!,Vincent Gebelle,4,"First and foremost I want to start off by saying that I don't understand why so many people are saying that these headphones don't fit over the ears properly! I have fairly large ears and my ears fit inside the cups. These headphones are very comfortable and they sound fantastic. I have been using Sennheiser products for many many moons now and I was very skeptical about buying these headphones after reading some very odd reviews (none of which are true). Here's the long and skinny of these headphones. The build quility is VERY GOOD, The Sound is VERY GOOD, the Noise Cancellation is okay, but not great. Just to give you a reference to what I am comparing them to. Previously before these, I owned the Sony XB 900s and I absolutely LOVED those headphones. Unfortuanetely the movers who moved me into my new house loved them too and they stole them from me =(. The noise cancellation on the Sony's is definitely more noticable and just better, but I do think that these headphones have a more accurate sound. HENSE the word ACCURATE! The Sony's sounded Awesome, but Sennheiser is known for there awesome accurate sounding headphones and these have that sound.Are they comfortable? Yes indeed they are. I can were these headphones for hours at a time and not get fatigued at all. I do think the Sony's were a little more comfortable and not as tight, but these aren't tight to the point where you have to take them off 10 minutes after putting them on.Now for the CONS: When you have the headphones on an you open up a music player or open any app really, you get an annoying speaker pop/click. I don't understand why, I have never had a pair of headphones that popped everytime you opened up an app or turned on or off the headphones. It's not loud and I don't want you to think that you are going to go deaf from this little speaker pop, it's harmless, but nonetheless annoying and a bad defect from an awesome company like Sennheiser. Also when I first put these headphones on for the very first time the sound sounded very narrow, like the sorround sound was turned off. The Sony's definetly had a more spacious sound. The more you listen to the Sennheisers, the better they sound and you will fall in love with the Amazing Sound!Bottom Line: These headphones are VERY GOOD Sounding headphones. If you just want awesome sound, these will not dissapoint! I have actually heard things in music that I have never heard before, that's how accurate they are. Commfort is like a 4 out of 5, maybe 3 1/2. I have never owned a pair of Bose headphones, so I am guessing that they are about as comfortable is they come. I don't want to mislead on comfortability, because I am sure there are headpones out there that feel like the ""My Pillow"" on your ears. Again nonetheless, these headphones are comfortable.","Reviewed in the United States March 13, 2022",AHCWDMRGNSEQOS2X2DDQ23AJAESA,TRUE,8,Style: OriginalColor: Black
R37PK1XGD8ND9Y,B083W7V3RG,1.0 out of 5 stars Frustrating and disappointing,Kindle customer,1,"My favorite pair of headphones from this brand had lasted me 6+ years, and I loved the way they sounded, so I finally decided to upgrade.When I took these out of the box and tried them out- the sound quality was great! BUT the sound only came out of the right ear. I turned them off and on again, charged them all the way up, messed with the L/R equalizer settings, tried with a different device, upgraded the firmware, read through the manual five times, and did a factory reset. Still no better. The wired connection works fine, but not the wireless.Ok, I thought. I they might’ve gotten jostled around or something in the mail. I’ll return them and get a replacement pair.Replacement pair comes- same thing. And again, I tried everything to get them to work. Another return.They’re a nice set of headphones. They seemed comfy and well made. The ANC seemed to be good, from what I could tell. There is something wrong however with their manufacturing or quality control for me to get two consecutive duds from what are not a cheap pair of headphones. Both pairs were not usable.I really wanted to like these, but I will not be buying from this brand ever again. I am extremely disappointed, extremely frustrated, and they have wasted my time. Let’s see if the Sony’s can compare, or at least function correctly out of the box.

RR257CQ7YTC77,B083W7V3RG,5.0 out of 5 stars So far excellent.,Mr. Yikes,5,"As a musician, I have trained ears. A lot of headphones bother me. I think most are designed and marketed to appeal to ignorance and hope people aren't able to tell a difference, like Beats adding weights to make them seem higher quality, but really they aren't that great. Companies charge more to say they have more bass, as if that's a sign of quality, but it isn't because the high end doesn't render and the cymbals are barely in the mix. When you listen to voices, you miss the ffffff ssssss cccc sounds in speech so calls are hard to understand and the singing isn't rendered fully. These aren't reference sound quality. You aren't going to master your record using them, but they are really in the ballpark. I'm always surprised listening to well recorded music just how well they render the sounds across the spectrum. They have an admirably flat frequency curve for what they are, and render bass, midrange and the highs well. They drop off a bit in the very high end, but I physically can't even hear that part of the spectrum anymore due to not being in my 20's anymore.I got these so I can move around the house, monitor my online teaching, listen to music and audiobooks. Even listening to a Zoom call, cheap ear buds and bassy headsets with poor highs make it hard to understand what people are saying. These really help.This is replacing the earlier version that has the Mini USB charge port that eventually died. I had those long enough that I put two different batteries in them, but they were eventually killed by a bad charge cable. I have since gotten much picker about charge and data cables (and I think you should too).I think the real equivalents are the Sonys. The Sony's are really good. The Sennheisers go on the ear more, while the Sonys go over the ear, so the Sonys are probably more comfortable for long sessions for most people. I don't find it a problem. I just readjust them a little periodically. The Sennheisers produce a nice flat frequency response across the spectrum with nearly equal response at all frequencies by default. The Sonys have a noticeable bump in the bass end y default. The Sonys do a good job across the spectrum, but the bass bump just kind of feels artificial and then you have to tinker in an app to try to fix it.","Reviewed in the United States July 15, 2024",AHQUNQTVAN42GYIH6TQAQFI2USGA,TRUE,0,Style: OriginalColor: Black
R21JCW97D1XCUO,B083W7V3RG,3.0 out of 5 stars 7 months later,Dusty,3,"for the first 6 months this product was pretty good. the sound canceling is okay, not as good as some other headphones within this price range, but does the job still. I have a pretty loud PC as well as a personal fan that will run and it does a good job drowning out those noises. traveling outside of the home can be dodgy, airplane sounds aren't as muted as i'd like and it doesn't really drown out talking, which is fine. the biggest issue i have with these headphones has been connectivity.it can be a big pain to get it to connect to computers, and it does this thing where every three connections you have to reset and reconnect all over again. i can connect it to multiple devices like my phone and computer, but the sound only comes from one unless you accidentally hit the voice to text button and then suddenly nothing works until a few seconds after you stop the voice to text. within the last month it's been dropping connection altogether and the only thing that gets it to connect is to turn it off and on. it makes a really loud noise when it does this as well.the funniest part about this headset I will say is the british lady who will at the most random times tell you your battery life. it's extremely funny when you record a dnd audio drama and you're in the middle of an intense scene and she just inexplicably says two hours into using the headset ""between 6 and 12 hours play time"".the headset charges fast and does hold it's charge for a long time. i can go days of regular use before needing to recharge, and i can generally get another 4 hours of charge in 10 minutes in a pinch. they are comfortable to wear if you can get your full ear into them, however not as comfortable if you wear glasses like i do. if you can tilt the arms of glasses up though it is comfortable. the headband part of the headset does have give to it, and doesn't give me headaches.all in all it's a descent headset for the price, i'll most likely be buying a new headset soon however, as the way it's been dropping every couple hours is getting really frustrating.","Reviewed in the United States June 18, 2024",AEL3S4W3IGZ3GR7YWSV5PD3UGHVA,TRUE,3,Style: Special EditionColor: Black
R2YESM37AQW500,B083W7V3RG,2.0 out of 5 stars Not worth the price,Josiah,2,"I went into these trying to be very open minded. I knew I wasn't going to get the sound quality from my favorite pair of bulky wired headphones that I usually use so I shouldn't judge them harshly. At first I was disappointed by the lack of clear high end frequencies. After a little bit of getting used to it (2 weeks) I thought it sounded fine. It seems to be very mid heavy by default, I tried to remedy this with the Smart Control app which helped a little. It's capable of replicating very low sub bass which is impressive. Its noise cancelling mode is decent although it's probably more fair to call it something like ""rumble cancelling"" since it's best at cutting out low frequencies around you while higher frequencies can still make it through pretty clear. However the bad part of these is that there are a ton of problems with the Bluetooth connectivity itself.After a month, the noise cancelling mode started making a very loud screeching sound. It sounded like interference of some sort which was strange as nothing had changed around me that would warrant this drastic change out of nowhere. I figured this wouldn't be an issue as long as I turned off noise cancelling mode. The noise still persisted in non-noise cancelling mode although much much quieter. After 2 months, the headphones started having trouble connecting to devices I had already paired them with. I would need to troubleshoot and manually try to connect them via the devices own Bluetooth settings. Now here I am 2 months after that and they completely refuse to ""turn on"" or connect to anything. I say ""turn on"" in quotations because it is very clearly on. It has power and I can toggle noise cancelling on or off, but every attempt to try and turn it on will make it announce ""power on"" and then have it act completely unresponsive. I can make it say ""power on"" multiple times in a row without it ever ""powering off"". If they do somehow manage to connect to a device and the device shows that it connected, it will disconnect immediately afterwards. I suspect the headphones will probably fix themselves after letting the battery die, but the fact that I have to go through this at all is enough to warrant a negative review.Some other good things to know are that it can support being connected to 2 devices at a time, although it can only play audio from one device at a time meaning it will stop audio coming from the device if you start playing audio on a different device. It also has an immensely hard time trying to connect to the Sennheiser Smart Control app. It works maybe 1/5th of the times you try it. You might have to power off the headphones and your phone multiple times before it decides to recognize them. And connecting to the app is 100% necessary if you want to disable a default setting that causes your own microphone audio to play through the headphones while on a call. I suppose this is so that you can hear yourself with the headphones on but it was more distracting than anything. The volume on these headphones work in a strange way I've never experienced before. Instead of being able to set it at any volume you please, there seem to be very noticeable ""steps"" in between audio levels. The lowest setting is nearly inaudible, the next setting up is not much different, and then the one above that is too loud. And it keeps going on and on. I have an android so I know I'm able to manually adjust the volume on a smooth slider by using the screen rather than the buttons which change the volume in those ""steps"". However doing this while connected to the headphones makes no difference as it still adheres to the headphones system of being too quiet and too loud and I genuinely have no clue how this works. I used to use Bluetooth earbuds in the past and they had no problem accepting the audio level that my phone provides. They were able to let me fine tune the volume as android normally allows. However these headphones don't let you do that.While the quality of the sound coming out of the headphones is fine, the amount of problems attached to them is not. I bought these for around $90 which I think is still way too much for what I got.Final verdict: save your money and put it towards something better.","Reviewed in the United States July 4, 2024",AEJH2EBXTJXY25E6XXMJXBMCVXMA,TRUE,1,Style: OriginalColor: Black
R3F5QNMYV9RV8T,B083W7V3RG,"5.0 out of 5 stars How to toggle ""Transparency/pass-through Mode"" & ""ANC Mode""?",GameDirection,5,"I am using my review as a way to communicate a confusing problem that I was able to figure out on my own.As for my review:- Sounds amazing- a bit tight (I have a medium/smaller sized head), will have to break them in more before extended periods of use.- The ANC is just as I expected and the fact they work as a headset is great too!- The mic quality is not ideal and terrible in the wind. It's nice to have in a pinch so you don't have to raise your phone to your mouth, but I wouldn't recommend trying to do any business that needs high-quality audio).- Battery life is solid and the USB-C is so convenient! Plus a clear voice that lets you know if they are powering on or off.- Easy to connect, a bit confusing to master (hence the second part of this review)Great Value Headphones, Meh as a Headset.---------- How to toggle ""Transparency/pass-through Mode"" & ""ANC Mode""? ------------I found a few comments mentioning that you are unable to turn it off the ""Transparency Mode"" or the pass-through sounds that are made ambiently around you, like voices, crinkling paper, and typing. This is not the same as ANC(Active Noice Cancellation) which removes only the ambient hum of the room like a fan, refrigerator, or airplane.This particular headset actually has two BlueTooth Connections or ""drivers"" on windows and mac.""Headphones (LE-HD 450BT Stereo)"" & ""Headset (HD 450BT Hands-Free AG Audio)""Mobile devices seem to auto-switch between these depending on if they are utilizing the mic in the Headset or not.Headphones (LE-HD 450BT Stereo): Does not utilize Transparency Mode, however ANC can be toggled. (Set this as ""Default"" if you do not want to here the Transparency mode)Headset (HD 450BT Hands-Free AG Audio): Seems to default Transparency Mode ON, and ANC can also be toggled when this is active as well. (If you make a lot of calls and utilize the mic setting this to ""Default"" may be more useful) If you use the Assistant button, this will automatically switch to this driver, but will revert if you have the headphones selected as ""Default"".**Extra Notes**If you have a 5.0 BlueTooth (internal or as an adapter) for your computer both of these are able to connect and you can toggle between these in your sound settings. Most modern mobile devices as of July 2016+ have this installed but you may use the AIDA64 app on the Google Play store to see if it's in your device.Apple Users: iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, HomePod, and the 2018 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar all (and newer devices) utilize the 5.0 or newer BlueTooth.I do not know what happens if you have an older version of BlueTooth, however, I speculate that switching between the two drivers may be clunky, and slower than it already is. However they will still connect, you may just run into issues connecting other devices simultaneously like a mouse and keyboard.The S 450BT WILL usually prioritize headphone mode, however, I hope this helps if you were confused.If you use the Headphone Jack it will put the headphones in Flight Mode and deactivate all BlueTooth Connections.","Reviewed in the United States May 1, 2021",AHR24KCYX22DGWZZCQYL5GZNCNHA,TRUE,12,Style: OriginalColor: Black

RFPP0VOWPBFH6,B083W7V3RG,3.0 out of 5 stars Great Sound - Mild Comfort - Not for PC,kslice,3,"Summary=======This headset offers great audio quality with fantastic ANC (Active Noise Cancelling). However, it leaves much to be desired in comfort (-1 star) and compatibility (-1 star). If you're going to be using these on a PC, you might want to continue reading as there are some unmentioned caveats that can be a game-changer for you.Comfort======Read the other reviews. There is plenty of mention about how the ear cuffs are just a tad too small and squeeze on the ears, causing discomfort. Unless you have notably small ears, this will affect you. You can try to reduce this by expanding the headset size. But even after a couple of weeks (which is normally all it takes for me to adjust), these things still cause discomfort. If you're going to be using these for intermittent, 30-minute conference calls (be careful, read about Compatibility below), it's tolerable. But if you plan to wear them all day, you might want to think twice.Compatibility==========This part is going to get pretty technical. But just know that if you're going to try to use these for conference calls, or anything that records audio on your *computer*, this probably isn't the headset for you. In my case, I set my PC up to use the mic on my conference speaker and the audio from the headset. It's a great alternative option, if available.These headsets are compatible with Bluetooth 5.0 and if you don't have that, you're not going to the get the full audio quality that these things are capable of. It's still backwards compatible, will work, and sounds great - but you're not going to get all that it has to offer. Most newer phones have this. But how new is your PC?Also, if you plan to do anything on the PC that records/transmits your microphone audio - you are not going to want to use the built-in mic here. It has nothing to do with the quality of the mic, but rather the lack of a good firmware (something that can be fixed by a simple software update). Put simply, when you use this thing on a PC, you are given two audio options. One is a hands-free option. In order to use the mic and hear audio at the same time, you have to use the hands-free option. Doing so drops your audio quality to what sounds worse than a $5 pair of earbuds from a gas station. To make matters worse, ANC is completely disabled and the ambient sound around you gets amplified back into the headset so everything around you is even louder.*Running Windows 10 with new USB Bluetooth 5.3 Receiver, headset firmware up to date*If you do research on this issue, you'll see some people say it's due to a bandwidth limitation in Bluetooth 5.0. The normal audio quality is so great, that it almost maxes out the bandwidth. So in order to stay within that limitation while recording audio, it has to drop the quality to stay within this limitation. The problem with this theory is that it doesn't do any of this while you're using it on a smart phone during a call. Also, why amplify my ambient noise? I can hear myself talk just fine.Some people suggest updating the firmware. Well, there is no way to do that with just a PC. Not a big issue if you can just connect it to your smartphone, download the app, and update the firmware. Then you can just remove the app. But you'll have to sign up for an account first (why?) Even with up-to-date firmware, this is still an issue. The worst part is that all it would take is for the manufacturer to update the firmware with these considerations in mind.","Reviewed in the United States December 20, 2022",AFHBNOGM77FKB76CNVKGP5PQSXCA,TRUE,21,Style: Special EditionColor: Black
RLGDBYQXKLZHL,B083W7V3RG,"3.0 out of 5 stars For me, uncomfortable and awkward",D Porter,3,"Earphones/headphones are a very individual item, what with fit, sound, controls, etc. For me, these were uncomfortable on my ears within minutes and painful after about a half hour. Headphones are usually described as ""over the ear"" or ""on the ear."" I'm 6'1"" and have been accused of having big ears but I think a person would have to be a midget to have these fit over the ear. The 450BT's are, for me anyway, definitely ON the ear. I bought these specifically to watch tv using the aptX feature. But, if they're painful to wear after a half hour, they won't work for that purpose, at least for me. I've used Sony and Bose over the ear 'phones that might cause some ear fatigue after awhile, but nothing like these. Even a cheap pair of Skullcandy phones, (definitely ON the ear), were much more comfortable for me. But, I also read reviews here from people who have no issue with pressure on their ears, so if they work for you or you like on the ear style phones, awesome.Controls are also somewhat awkward and strangely arranged, making them difficult to use while wearing, as other reviewers have also noted. There are lots of similar headphones out there with controls on the sides, *all* of them that I've seen are better than these. Again, even my cheap pair of Skullcandy on-the-ear phones have buttons that are big, easy to use, and almost impossible to have to fumble with - they're great. By contrast, in the short time I was trying these 450BT's, I was constantly having trouble finding the volume button, accidentally pausing or fast-forwarding what I was watching, or turning them off. I'm sure most people would *eventually* get used to the controls, but why design them so you have to?In my short time trying them out, the sound seemed warm, inviting, but a little heavy on the mids and lows, and I had to really crank them louder than I'm used to to hear dialogue. The app that Sennheiser tells you to download would probably work to help adjust these issues and I note that other reviewers praise the sound these deliver, especially after using the in-app EQ.Because of the fit which will does not make it comfortable for me watch even one tv program, coupled with the constant irritation of the poorly designed controls, I'll be returning the 450BT's and happy to be rid of them.","Reviewed in the United States December 30, 2023",AFG65WM2YPS44OXUMUNMJEXXO5DQ,TRUE,1,Style: OriginalColor: Black

They also paired well with my Hisense U8G 65"".There are so many great things to say about Seinnheiser in general. It's impossible to knock them on build quality, looks, and sound.The ear cushions on these are made for children. Anyone with larger ears will likely suffer pain. I can make it about 20 minutes before I reach for my Ankbit E600Pro's to give my ears a break. I found some GVOEARS replacement ear cushions that suposedly help with exactly that ear discomfort problem.The on and off functions is badly implemented. To turn on, you have to press the on button for two seconds, but even a fraction of a second more and it goes into pairing mode. To fix, you have to turn if off and back on (more carefully this time). It's supposed to take 4 seconds to flip into pairing mode, but by the time the voice start's to say it's powered on, it's too late. There is a very (very) subtle click that you can listen for to know when to release (any ""Quick and The Dead"" fans here?). What would be great is if the power button turned them on and off instantly, but maybe that's not going to happen with multi-function buttons on a bluetooth device.My daughter shuns these because of what she considers weird button placement. I like the fact that I can find the volume buttons (there's a bump on the + side).I'm knocking one star off for the discomfort and pairing mode pitfall. I know Seinnheisers do break in/loosen (too much sometimes), so if that happens or the replacement earpads fix the discomfort, I'll update the review.","Reviewed in the United States November 28, 2023",AH7LSJMTNS7OFQ4OXZ5O7VTKZXIQ,TRUE,1,Style: Special EditionColor: Black

It does come with a headphone cord/ audio jack, so not completely wireless. The press and hold for the On/Off button could be shorter (time-wise).My only gripe with them is they disconnect as soon as I answer a phone call. I discovered this while job hunting. You have to go into settings and reconnect during the first part of every phone call, and then for some reason they disconnect after 5 minutes exactly.

R2VJSWJLV3QHV6,B083W7V3RG,"3.0 out of 5 stars Great Quality, Terrible QOL",Eric,3,"These headphones offer a great sound experience for the price, there's not denying that. The noise cancelling is excellent and the quality of the sound is both extensive and full. If that and the price were all there was to judge about these headphones, they'd have a 5. But, the headphones also are meant to offer several hands-off features and QOL bits which, to put simply, hardly work. The built in ability to pause and skip or rewind, offered through a poorly thought out design of a single toggle that moves, works only about 10 percent of the time. Additionally, the thought process behind this bit of hardware seems not to have been well thought out or tested. To pause, skip, or rewind, the headphones have a plastic bit that can be pushed in, pushed forward, or pushed backward respectively. However I've found that more often than not, when I go to pause the headphones will register it as a skip instead. This could be because I press on the toggle when I go to skip, sure, but even when I'm exceptionally careful about this, I still have issues.Additionally, there is no way to check what the headphone's battery life is at. On my old Sony headphones which were about $50, I could at least hit a button and hear a range of time I had left. With these, you get a warning that you have somewhere between 2-5 hours of battery life left, and that only pops up once in that time span from what I've seen. Very easy to miss if, by chance, you take the headphones off for a minute.What's more, there's a continual issue with these that when they disconnect from something they will continually and constantly alert you to this fact until you turn them off and on again. Yes, I know I disconnected you from my computer. I did that so I could listen to music on my phone, but you keep warning me that you've ""been disconnected."" It's an easy fix of restarting, but I just don't see why this is an issue I should have to deal with.Finally, while the headphones aren't uncomfortable, they certainly do my head and ears no favors if I happen to have them on for more than a few hours. They have a habit of squeezing your ears in, which is painful after a few hours. The headband is adjustable but the fabric used to cushion has a tendency to also be rather grippy, which can cause some strange head fatigue I've found.Compared again to the previous headphones I had for $50, the sound quality is incredible. For that alone I would say if you're in the market for excellent quality headphones for the price, these are probably them. But on almost every other front I would rather have those Sony headphones again.Buy with caution, I would say.","Reviewed in the United States January 10, 2023",AEU7LFL65HGNSPCAY4VA2UKSLIRQ,TRUE,7,Style: OriginalColor: Black

I do not need to know what my battery level is unless it's low, but these headphones will inform you of the battery level at full charge. To top it all off, even those notifications are useless. It will tell you ""Between 6 and 12 hours remaining"". Why in the world would I need to know that and how can you only know battery life within a 6 hour window.Turning on the headphones has no immediate feedback and the difference between pressing the on button to just turn it on and held to pair is miniscule. You will constantly go into pairing mode when you mean to just turn it on and won't know which you did until you hear ""Pairing..."" a couple of seconds later.

It’s infuriating! 😤- Active Noise Canceling (ANC): It makes a difference, but it’s negligible at best!- Audio Tuning: Everything sounds flat and lifeless, with volume bouncing up and down inexplicably! 😳- No Proximity Sensor so they don’t pause when take them off which is real nuisance 😑- SE stands for Special Edition, but I can’t figure out what's so special about them. Seriously, what is it?🤔- The Price You Pay: At $200 MSRP, this set is a hard sell! On sale for $80, it’s still a pass for me!

However, I ended up having a number of problems with them:1. The headset was fairly uncomfortable at first. I saw this in reviews and prepared for it, but it still took some time to break them in and get used to how stiff the ear cups were.2. Difficulties with the app. Not only did I have a hard time initially pairing the headphones to the app (they connected to my phone's bluetooth fine, the app just refused to recognize they were connected), but once connected, the app seemed to not have many features to it. Not having the ability to switch between connected devices in the app was especially rough.3. Trouble with powering on. After a few months, the headphones would make a high pitched squealing noise when I tried to turn them on. It would take a few attempts before they would finally power on, before eventually refusing to power on at all until I reset the headphones.4. After 3-4 months of ownership, no sound came out of one ear via bluetooth. I could tell noise cancelling was still working on that side, they just refused to play any audio. Resetting the headphones did not fix this one.After point number 4, I was ready to give up on these, and contacted Sennheiser for a warranty replacement. To my surprise, they sent me back a completely different (better) model instead. So if you're looking at these, I HIGHLY recommend spending a bit more and getting the Accentum Plus model instead.

R3HBIYDPPDRXTI,B083W7V3RG,3.0 out of 5 stars Worth considering other options,Sam Meyers,3,"I enjoyed music quality and comfort as well as BT5.0 and USB C charging. Battery life is solid and it is easy to pair and use. Some call the controls complicated and though I agree the play/pause button isn't well done, I adjusted in a few days and was mostly fine. I did contact support for help with my issues. None was available.I'm returning this product for the following reasons, in no particular order. I don't recommend you purchase these unless they fall under $100 or you are fine with the issues.1. ANC toggles on and off with the push of a button for a purple indicator light. You get a second or two where the audio drops out while this kicks in. Or maybe off. There is no indication, on the headphones or app, that say ANC is on or off. the light toggles purple either way. You can guess given ambient noise but you'll never know! There is no known fix for this or support had no input.2. ANC seems to kick in for calls with something they call sidetone. It pipes in ambient audio so you can hear yourself and not be too loud. Except, I just hear everything except the call. Call audio drops below ambient noise, even just working in the kitchen or tasks where a speakerphone might cut it. So these are useless to me on calls and I redirect to the headset I am trying to replace. It might as well not have call options at all. No fix or patch coming as far as support has said.3. If you pair this to 2 devices, say your phone and a laptop, you have to be careful to disconnect when you go out of range of 1 device. If you do walk away or go on a walk, you will need to power off the headphones then power them back on and connect to the 1 device (out of range of the other device). Otherwise, you will have a nice British voice say 'Disconnected' every 5 seconds. No, the device does not reconnect when back in range, at least not reliably for me to notice it tried to. There is also no fix for this though it's entirely software...With that in mind, are these a good fit? For about $100 I'd probably keep them but need a second headset of the same type for calls, making them effectively useless if the other set has noise cancelling and decent audio. There may not be better headphones at that price range either, feature wise. I appreciate USB C. The audio cable it comes with works well though may be short for large desk spaces. Battery life is great as I went maybe 4 days straight with extended use before charging, but not because they needed a charge. They are comfortable on my head, though some may find the top band a bit thin.","Reviewed in the United States June 23, 2020",AFMBGDGZMOHY2ZY42WRV2754XYZQ,TRUE,284,Style: OriginalColor: Black

Still not bad quality but you really do notice the difference. Gonna be honest, this is far below the usual Sennheiser product quality. Like.. what was the plan here? Nothing worked out of the box, which is in-line with a lot of the reviews I'm seeing here. My friend has this exact pair and it worked fine for him?? I'm only keeping the rating at 2 stars because it will still run on aux. The return process is a pain for stuff like this so I will hold onto these as a backup set.Off-rip this thing gave me plenty of trouble. The set just wouldn't go into connecting mode, and eventually just stopped turning on entirely. The one saving grace is that it does just work if you use the detachable AUX. I saw a few mixed reviews outside Amazon that mentioned this, but I didn't think it would happen to me. Unfortunately, the built-in mic will only work when connected via bluetooth, or at least that's what my Linux setup restricts me toIf you don't have a standalone mic and are running into this issue, well...Pros:Sound quality is almost top-tier. The only other headsets that sound better, fit worse. If you have ears made of steel, OneOdio has better sound quality. If you turn on noise cancelling you do get slightly better sound and noticeable bass. This does work without actually having to power on the headset (thank goodness).Cons:Quite literally everything else. This is just a more expensive version of my Hyper-X set. Better quality, no mic (again, because no bluetooth, no power-on, etc). And yeah, that means the voice assistant, etc. are a lost cause as well.Overall, I'm disappointed.

The noise cancelling isn't that great. I can still hear everything around me just slightly muffled. Not going to help drown out my noisey office mates conversations. But the biggest disappointment is the comfort. They take a good few seconds of moving around the ear to get your ears tucked in and the ear ups are touching every square inch of your ear with non-to-gentle pressure. They are a little better if you can rotate the ear cups and pivot them forward toward your temples. But I wouldn't wast your time.

RM9WL2Y1M01SF,B083W7V3RG,3.0 out of 5 stars Good for price range,Janos Braun,3,"I've had these headphones now for 3 years and decided it's about time to write a review. These headphones have served me through thick and thin and for the price you are paying serve their purpose wonderfully. To start off with the noise cancellation, these headphones are not the best for that, and I feel like there is definitely better products out there if noise cancelling is your primarily goal. I couldn't even say that the noise cancelling is good, if you are in a moderately filled room, they may serve you well enough so you can't clearly make out any words, but you'll still hear stuff. I'm going to void over the noise quality as my experience in this department is really small, but I mean you'll hear stuff, and you'll enjoy your music comfortably. Lastly, and this is single handedly my biggest issue with this headset, battery life. It has a great battery life, I often forget to charge it just due to how long it lasts me. I am a college student who enjoys skateboarding and my quiet studying time, so I am always using these headphones, you'll never find me without them on my college campus. The issue that stems from the battery life is its on-board battery reminder. The headphones will ENSURE you are aware of their current battery life, every few minutes you will be hit with the blaringly loud, annoying, and intrusive reminder that your headset has 6-12 hours of battery life or less than 6 hours. Not the best and most specific way to inform the user of the battery life. This friendly reminder will interrupt anything and everything you are listening too without fail and it will do it fairly consistently over the course of 30 minutes. In fact, prior to this review I had an online meeting and half of my meeting was interrupted by the constant reminder saying, ""6 to 12 hours play time"". This won't shut off your music, video, or call but it will loudly interrupt it. Other than that, I highly recommend this headset for its price range though if you have the money for something better, please get something better.","Reviewed in the United States January 17, 2023",AGNGKZCRCWE4VI5NG7II2HTEKQIQ,TRUE,2,Style: OriginalColor: Black

The bass (lows) are actually adjustable slightly in the Smart Control equalizer and iPhone settings, so the bass (lows) are better than expected.BUILD QUALITYThe build quality thus far is good and better than expected.ACTIVE NOISE CANCELLATIONThe ANC (active noise cancellation) is average at best, but does appear to reduce the outside noise by approximately 35%.BLUETOOTH WIRELESS and WIRED CONNECTIVITYThe Bluetooth codecs will be more than enough to please the casual audio listener and on any device. Since these headphones also have wired cable connectivity (better than Bluetooth, playing lossless uncompressed audio), these headphones are all that is needed. The one odd, whether you take it as good or bad, is the audio cable connector is keyed. This provides a locking type of connection so that the cable does not wiggle or loosen easily. Connecting the cable takes getting used to, but works well.SMART CONTROL APPThe Smart Control app has limited functionality. It is too bad you can't control the functions in the app that the physical buttons provide.AMAZON ALEXAThe SE (special edition) version includes Amazon Alexa, if that is important to you, but other than this, both models are identical. I didn't need Alex, but the SE was quite a bit cheaper during one of the Black Friday or Cyber Monday deals for $75.00.CHARGINGI do not believe these are considered fast charging as it took 2 or more hours to fully charge.RECOMMENDATIONI would recommend these headphones at any price range whether at retail or reduced, because of the sound and build quality as well as the other numerous features it offers.","Reviewed in the United States December 13, 2022",AHR5MYSWNWCSTWJ2BPGSBA7KNOFQ,TRUE,12,Style: Special EditionColor: Black

R3TNQBMLUXU1NQ,B083W7V3RG,3.0 out of 5 stars Complete failures,Nobody,3,"I purchased these for my son because of the reviews and the quality of the name.I wish I had done more research. The quality is actually good, but I have multiple issues with these headphones.When my son started using them, he complained that he could only wear them for an hour before they started hurting. Since he is nine, I assumed he was just wearing them a little tight.After about a month he quit using them completely, so I started to use them and gave him a pair of Wyze headphones.After wearing them once, I totally agree with him. First, the padding on the headband is not enough. It would almost be better not to have any since what is there is not enough to matter. In addition to this, the ear cups are so small, they do not actually fit around your ears, but pretty much pin your ears to your head. After a little while of wearing them, the top of your head AND your ears hurt!Moving from the uncomfortable, we go on to the buttons. Whomever thought that it was a good idea to have so many buttons on one ear should be fired. There are five buttons. The power button, volume up/down, a multi-function button that pushes left right and in and another button right next to it. They are also extremely close together. When wearing thin gloves, good luck trying to hit one button. Also, the power button has to be pressed 3 seconds to be turned on, more, it goes into pairing mode, less, no dice. The only indication that they are on is a tiny single click that sounds like static.Next, these headphones do allow you to pair to two different devices, but don't expect multipoint. They are not. Adding to this, if are connected to two devices and walk away from one, a kind voice tells you that they disconnected, and will continue to say it every 20 or 30 seconds and NOT stop. Usually by the 4th or 5th reminder, I turn the headphones ofd and back on. This does fix that. I even emailed support about this and got a generic answer that pretty much said they were working properly.With all of this in mind, these are FAR from worth the price.I have a pair of Sony's and a pair of Wyze. The Sony headphones have better noise cancellation and are far more comfortable for the same price. The Wyze are also far more comfortable, have better noise cancellation, better functionality and only cost $50.","Reviewed in the United States January 29, 2021",AHMWA5IGV2T3NO2NLJL5EA34635Q,TRUE,2,Style: OriginalColor: Black
RQ3F32FG299IY,B083W7V3RG,"3.0 out of 5 stars Good sound quality & unobtrusive ANC, but not very comfortable and causes Teams to crash",Jmatt,3,"The Good:I like the sound quality and the ANC works well (couldn't hear my wife yelling down the stairs to me though, which ticked her off.....). The controls are reasonably intuitive and I mostly like the multipoint connection - it switched between my computer and phone pretty seamlessly. Stop playing music on one and start it on the other, and the headphones automatically switch sources. I haven't had problems with battery life.The bad:1) Not very comfortable. They squeeze fairly hard which gives me headaches and the ear cups are on the small side which hurt my ears after a bit. I can only wear them for 2-3hrs before I have to take them off.2) Doesn't play nice with MS Teams. When connected via bluetooth they cause MS Teams (for work & school) to crash. Not sure about Teams for personal use. Teams works fine with other bluetooth headsets, with wired headsets, and with the built-in laptop speakers. However, if I try to make a Teams call when these headphones when connected via bluetooth, Teams crashes, my computer thinks it has no audio output devices at all, and I can't listen to music, play videos, make calls, etc using *any* audio output devices until I restart my computer. These headphones *do* work fine with Zoom. I contacted Sennheiser support, and they suggested updating the firmware to the November 2022 version. This didn't fix the problem and they didn't have any other ideas.3) Phone call quality kinda sucks. Tinny, the incoming audio cuts out from time to time, and there's a distracting ambient audio pass-through that is distracting (it amplifies little sounds).Bottom line is that I'm returning them as soon as the other headphones I ordered arrive.","Reviewed in the United States December 2, 2022",AFO4CUGAPISR5EBB7JO6C2TRIAUQ,TRUE,4,Style: OriginalColor: Black

R2H7L51C3WVD3E,B083W7V3RG,2.0 out of 5 stars Useless for watching TV. AptX LL doesn't seem to work.,MiamiGuitarMan,2,"I'll start with the summary - I am sending these back because they don't work with Bluetooth transmitters using aptx LL for watching TV.What I liked about them - They sound great. I listened to music and watched videos on my laptop both wired and wireless. They really do sound good.The ANC is OK. Nothing great, but it does a half decent job of blocking out consistent droning sounds like leaf blowers, vacuum cleaners, etc... But it doesn't compare to the ANC on headphones like the Bose QC35 II or even the comparably priced Sony H910N. But it's passable.What I didn't like about them and why they are going back -1. I bought these to watch TV without annoying everyone else in the house. My setup is very simple. I have an Avantree Audikast bluetooth transmitter which I've been using with a set of cheap Avantree headphones, but I've been wanting something with better sound.If anyone has every tried watching TV with bluetooth headphones, you may have noticed that the audio and video are usually out of sync. The reason I bought these particular headphones is because they have a codec called AptX LL (low latency) which fixes the problem of the audio and video being out of sync when using bluetooth to watch TV. There are very few headphones currently on the market that support AptX LL so my choices were limited. But I know the Sennheiser name and because these cans use AptX LL, I decided to buy them. The Avantree Audikast also uses AptX LL.Here's the problem - they do connect to the Avantree Audikast but I get no sound. I first used an older Audikast with BT 4 and thought maybe that was the problem so I spent $60 to get an Audikast Plus that uses BT 5.0. It arrived earlier today and I set it up, tried it, same problem. The headphones pair with it but there is no sound. The Audikast Plus even has its own volume control and I thought maybe that would help too but it didn't.I made sure it wasn't a problem with the Audikast and the Audikast Plus by trying two different sets of Avantree headphones, both were different models, that also support AptX LL and both of them worked perfectly.I also tried a set of Bose QC35II, a set of Sonys, and a cheap Jabra. These don't support AptX LL but they did connect and I had no trouble getting sound. But of course, because they don't support AptX LL, I can't really use them for watching TV. But I did use them to make sure that the problem wasn't the Audikast units.I think I've narrowed it down to the Sennheiser's implementation of Aptx LL.So, this is the primary reason they are going back. The AptX LL simply doesn't work.Other things I didn't like - they are very tight and the ear cutouts are too small so they pinned my ears to the side of my head and after a couple of hours they became uncomfortable.The headband has almost no padding and is also uncomfortable after a while.So in addition to them not working at all for watching TV using a BT transmitter that uses Aptx LL, they are also uncomfortable.Overall, sound = 4, ANC = 3, comfort = 2, AptX LL support = 0. Overall, I can't really rate them higher than two stars.","Reviewed in the United States September 1, 2020",AEBR3ASFNWICL7FX6ISOQKYRC5PQ,TRUE,14,Style: OriginalColor: Black

So if you break them you'd have to order from the company itself.-Whenever your battery is low, every time you have audio and it stops or pauses, it'll tell you the battery is low.-When using Bluetooth there is a buzzing sound when you are not listening to audio (sometimes, it's random).-The part that lays on your head is made from a lower quality material considering the price.-The noise cancelation is worse than some 40$ headphones I've used, which doesn't bother me too much as I never use it, but it's not good for those who care.Conclusion, I wouldn't buy again, purely to try to get butter luck with a different product. I like what I have and the audio when plugged in is amazing, but I can't justify spending this much other than the build quality is stronger than others.

This is apparently a common phenomenon with Sennheisers. I have had mine for about 1.5 months and the crackling still persists when the volume is above half way.- If you have a big head like me, the headphones simply will not fit without top-of-the-head discomfort.- If a device that the headphones are powered to disconnects, your headphones will remind you every 6 seconds (by saying ""LOST CONNECTION"" until the device it was connected to powers back on, OR you turn off the headphones entirely and turn them back on.- The app is terrible and confusing. I love that I can adjust my headphones and update firmware, BUT there needs to be a comprehensive settings menu that is more than two check boxes.The Awful:- When connected to a device, the noise-cancelling lets out a constant static-y ringing noise which is so incredibly annoying. If you want noise cancelling on its own, you either need to be 1) Not connected to a device via Bluetooth, OR 2) have an application or system audio that is playing sound for the sharp ringing to go away.All of the problems that I have listed are apparently sporadically common with others.

They deserve a higher rating but I am also a bit biased because my entire stage is filled with Sennheiser from drums to vocals, sennheiser makes everything simple to dial in. I’ve listened through through these Bluetooth headphones for less than 5 hours and they are scratching the audio itch (if you’re a fellow audiophile like myself, then you know what I’m talking about). I prefer low frequencies and deep bass. These headphones will definitely amplify those frequencies and drown out the surrounding noises with the ANC feature.I am a live audio engineer and I absolutely love when sounds through headphones can put me into a meditative/droning relaxation state. Before this, I’ve owned 2 JBL headphones. The JBL’s sound great but I’ve had a hard time dialing them in because there isn’t an app to help you with frequency dynamics and you’re left with the streaming audio app EQ. Sennheiser has one app to focus on getting the right sound through most of their headphones/earbuds. The combination of the app and headphones definitely scratched an itch I never thought possible in my brain and I am thankful for their technology. I know I sound like a fanboy and I try to aim not to be for any company who develops a product but when the credit is deserved then it is well worth mentioning. If you are an audiophile like myself and looking for a decent pair of headphones and not looking to spend $300 then these are for you.","Reviewed in the United States April 1, 2023",AEXHPDD372YZPNEJAFTXOVHMQV4Q,TRUE,4,Style: OriginalColor: Black

There are some cons though. The headrest is very thin and becomes uncomfortable quickly, I fix this by wearing a beanie. The headphones themselves are made for people with small ears, so if you have big ears you're going to have to change the pads or skip on these headphones entirely. These headphones are great if you're sitting at a desk, I definitely would not recommend them if you plan to get these for working out as they are stuffy and trap sweat.As for the pros, as I said before the audio quality of great and the NC is appropriate for the price of the product while on sale. The build is sleek and the materiel isn't cheap plastic that creaks at the slightest touch. You can listen to audio at about 40% volume before the noise starts to leak, which I think is more than enough.

They last all day and half the next day for me constantly playing music mid volume lvl. or like 2 to 3 days of and on or keeping on(forgetting to turn off). Call quality/ background noise cancelling is awesome. It matches sound quality you expect from Sennheiser. I wasn't a fan of how heavy they were at first but easy to get used to for sure. In the review photo you can see I have added a small spacer to raise them since my ears are very small and they sat too low. I do not recommend exercising or sweating in them as they slip off but I have tiny head so could very much just be me. They can get warm around the ears but dang do they have excellent noise cancelling and I almost always find myself walking around with them on but no sound on to avoid people talking to me while out and about much more effective than buds but still hear for safety. Easy to get used to buttons. Special note and tip. If they are off, and you get a call, you can turn them on and it will answer the call as soon as you turn them on (if auto connect and Bluetooth is on) Amazing call quality too.

They do an adequate job of noise cancellation but since I mostly listen in my home office that's not a particularly important aspect.At the time I bought them they were under the ""return by Jan 31"" time limit and I'm satisfied with them.

R86XG0YNFYVLU,B083W7V3RG,2.0 out of 5 stars Not made for work. Might be poorly made for entertainment,E.L.,2,"I will not recommend this headphone to anyone who plans on using it for work due to the following reasons.First, when working with Microsoft Teams, the head phone would generate a beep every 10s when muted which is really annoying. I googled it online and some articles said that you can turn the “Mute Beeps” off in EPOS Connect. I installed EPOS Connect app both on my cell phone and on my computers, but this app cannot connect to HD 450BT no matter what. I cannot appreciate the fact that the Sennheiser engineer thought adding a mute beep feature by default (especially cannot be easily turned off) is a good idea as it is very distraction, to the extent that you cannot concentrate on what other people is talking about. There is another app called “Smart Connect”, which is offered by Sennheiser, is very limited in functions, at least you cannot change the mute beep in it.Second, HD 450BT has an active noise cancellation feature, but does it only work with listening to music? When working with Microsoft Teams, the headphone would greatly magnify the background noise. Any small sound, even sound you would normally ignore when not using a headphone (like putting a pen on the table) would be heard clearly during meetings. Luckily, only the user hears the magnified sound, not other participants in the phone calls, but is still very annoying. It seems this problem persist when the active noise cancellation feature is either open or closed. I guess the phone want to make you aware of what is going on around you, but too bad you cannot turn the background noise off. Instead, they make it louder for you!I am amused to learn the design philosophy of the Sennheiser engineer of this product. Do they really thing that concentrating on what other people are saying during meetings is not important at all? I will not consider buying any Sennheiser products for a long time, due to their ignorance of the basic requirements of users.For customers buying this product for listening to music only, this might be an acceptable device, even though the sound quality is a little disappointed for a device of its price.","Reviewed in the United States March 6, 2023",AFU2EHQD5OMFX6HSBQB7UUGP72VA,TRUE,0,Style: OriginalColor: Black

R1MSNX72G0O5QM,B083W7V3RG,1.0 out of 5 stars UPDATE: Broke after 1 Year and 2 Months!,L,1,"December 2023 Update: I bought these headphones in October 2022 for about $100, and now sound only comes out of the left side. If you do an online search for the Sennheiser 450BT, searching for info on it only working in one ear, then you'll be able to find that I'm not alone in having this problem. This is a common problem for these headphones. I have treated them gently. They have only been used indoors at my desk, and they have never been dropped or mishandled in any way. There is no reasonable excuse for their short lifespan at their $100 price point.I highly suggest not only going with a different pair of headphones, but staying away from this brand. My original review is below. I liked them well enough when they worked. However, for $100 I expect more than a little over a year of functionality.ORIGINAL REVIEW:They're comfortable to wear, and music sounds lovely on them. However, they fall short of many of the marketing's claims. As such, I think they're only good for listening to audio, they're awful at the call functions to the point that pairing them with a phone can be a risky move, noise cancellation is poor, and their battery life is poor.I wouldn't use them for calls. The buttons for that are unoptimal, because button 10 is for both music and call functions. I bumped the wrong button function once, and heard them say ""redialing."" That would've been bad if it my headphones been connected to my phone instead of my computer, and the redial worked, because I was listening to music late at night. I disabled their ability to use the call functions on my phone, in my phone's bluetooth device settings, and I recommend doing that if they're purchased.As for noise cancelling, they're pretty poor at it. I hear either slightly muffled noise, or brown noise. I tried comparing outside noises when noise cancellation was both on and off. I noticed no real difference. However, since these headphones cover my ears well, and I don't want to tune everything out, external noise is muffled enough to satisfy me. However, if I traveled often or endured very noisy environments, then I'd be dissatisfied, and so I can't recommend this feature.Their battery life is poor. They're supposed to last 30 hours on a charge. Yet, I find myself needing to charge them daily. I only use them for listening to music and videos, and at a low volume.","Reviewed in the United States October 18, 2023",AEW4ZZK5GGVP6ETGECSKCJLTI3IA,TRUE,24,Style: OriginalColor: Black

Sound quality is exactly what I've come to expect from Sennheiser, which is why I keep buying them. The ear cups are quite comfortable, while the headband is merely OK. It could use some more padding. Bluetooth pairing is easy the first time, and much faster to transfer audio than my last pair of BT headphones.Two downsides: the noise canceling function is on by default, every time you turn the headphones on. I really only want noise canceling for airplanes, not for home use. You can turn it off, but it'll come right back on the next time the headphones do. Second, all the controls are clustered on the right earpiece. Since there are four controls and 2 plugs (USB-C and 3.5mm), it can be a bit annoying to find the one you want, whereas splitting them between the two earpieces would lead to less confusion and fumbling. I want to say these are minor quibbles for an excellent pair of headphones.

You can hear the separate instruments, which especially matters if one is listening to accoustic music. There is an equalizer app one can download to boost the treble, bass or midrange. It won't give you super booming bass, but perhaps other apps do - I haven't tried any yet. What I mostly like is that the audio is natural and full. The Beats offer more bass, but it's at the expense of compressing the audio. I can't say much about the noise cancelling capabilities, since I use these mainly to listen to music, but if they cared as much about that as they do sound quality, I assume it can't be all that bad. The size of the earpieces seem a bit large, but they are extremely comfortable. I have worn these for hours at a time, whereas with the Beats Solo3, I couldn't stand them for more than 45 minutes because they squeezed my ears and head so hard. The controls are a bit tiny and took some getting used to, but they worked fine. The power button on the Beats cannot be felt by a normal hand unless you can read Braille - it is flat, tiny, and impossible to locate.

I am going to address most of the complaints in others reviews.The Active noise cancellation is great for a $150 headphones, but high price headphones from microsoft, or sony, or bose that's probably 200-400 dollars will blow these out of the water. But it does work, and it does block out noises. Most effectively: repeating noise like that of a car or a train or an airplane or air conditioners, etc. It blocks out voices, but not that much. You can definitely hear others when your not listening to anything.The sound quality can also be thrown out when considering other headphones. Sennheiser creates headphones with the best sound quality, but this pair of headphones wasn't really created for that. It has every quality a good $150 dollar wireless headphones has, that a lot of other headphones don't have. So you can't really say it sucks, because it has a different purpose. However, the sound still rocks. It's so clear and precise. The best bang for your buck if you're a casual listener that doesn't want to spend too much.Battery life is one of the best so nuff said really.I have not experienced hissing sounds and the music quality is very very great. I have experienced bad sounds/ hiss when the audio jack is not properly attached though. The audio cable needs to be inserted in a specific way. If it isn't you will experience what a $1 headphones sounds like.Latency is definitely there even if the product claims low latency. It's manageable, but it still is very noticeable.It has a light build and is smaller than expected. As some claim its ear cups and headband are too small, it fits nicely with me, and it isn't even fully adjusted yet. I think most people would like it. If you have a big head/ears though, don't waste your money and time ordering these. I can wear this for hours though.The free case is small, if you travel a lot and have some extra cash to burn, I'd suggest ordering something to go with these.The worst problem for me is the comfort-ability while wearing glasses.

I wish I hadn't.The headphones were entirely unable to maintain a connection to any device, furthermore the reset procedure for the 450bt's, as explicitly directed by the manufacturer, did nothing at all. Upon further investigation, I discovered that this is a known issue with this specific model, that Sennheiser is aware of the issue, and that they either can't or won't offer a solution outside of return despite continuing to sell the product. This has changed my perception of the company, and I don't think I can take their reputation as a quality manufacturer seriously going forward.

R57LNBSMK8IC6,B083W7V3RG,5.0 out of 5 stars Glad I bought these.,Coz,5,"Update: I wish the ear pads were larger and found info about the WC Wicked Cushions Replacement Ear Pads for Sony MDR 7506 will work and not change the sound signature much. They are a little large where they fit on the headphone and will stay on. My ears fit inside unlike the original pads.I wanted a good sounding wireless headphone. These did the job for me. If the music has deep bass then you will hear it. I like headphones that have a flat frequency response. I want to hear the music as it is, not how some headphones makes extra bass. I like the fit and I do not agree these are not over the ear. To get a good fit I move them side to side over my ears to get the best fit/sound for me. I can listen for many hours and no pain on the ears. The battery does have a long life before needing a recharge. I tried with and without ANC and it sounds good on both. When it is off the sound had a wider frequency response. I like how it folds and I know it comes with a soft case and I bought the LTGEM hard case. I did not buy or use these to use on phone calls so no info how good that works. As far as the ANC it works for the little testing I did. Just around the house. I do notice a difference with outside noise. Noise cancellation is solid, but not class-leading like the $$$ wireless headphones. The BT works with all my devices and the type C charging is another plus. No regrets.","Reviewed in the United States October 2, 2021",AFEIMBKDZRCN33K2YPNCGV4EQAZQ,TRUE,1,Style: OriginalColor: Black

R38RYCTZP444HB,B083W7V3RG,2.0 out of 5 stars Decent sounding headphones with a handful of issues that some might find deal breaking.,Dave P.,2,"I bought these thinking they were over ear headphones, but they're actually on ear, and my ears get painful to the touch after half an hour of wearing on ear headphones, so I generally avoid them like the plague. Thinking these were over ear, I bought them because they are a well know name brand I've used before and trust, and because they are also AptX-LL, which I needed.I only use then with my TV watching videos (Netflix, Prime, Disney+, etc.) or playing console games, and for that they sound great and have zero perceptible delay. They are plastic, and feel plastic, so they're not as premium feeling as my Microsoft Surface headphones, but they are still well worth the sale price of $100USD I paid for them, though I don't believe they'd be worth the regular asking price of $150USD, especially factoring in the firmware issue discussed further on.The noise cancellation does appear to work, but I didn't buy them for that as they are only ever going to be used at home, so the quality of the NC isn't a big deal to me.Another small annoyance I noticed was that it has a 2.5mm jack on it for using in wired mode. Now it does include a cord that is 2.5mm on one end and 3.5mm on the other end for attaching it to your phone or tablet or whatever you want to, but that requires that you always have the specific cord that came with it as opposed to using regular audio cables that are 3.5mm on both ends. Once again, I'm able to look past this due to my use case being for at home TV viewing only.I tried to update the firmware using the companion app, and it took five hours, no joke. Notice I said try, because after that five f***ing hours updating, it failed and said to try again. I decided to forego trying to update the firmware again as it's not that big a deal, again because they are for at home TV viewing only.Aside from the pain of wearing them and the horrendous firmware updating issue, I'm still happy with my purchase. My issues might be deal breakers for others, at the same time though, my use case is limited, so I can look past those issues. Others looking to use these as everyday use might want to look elsewhere if they have sensitive ears and don't want to wait five hours for a firmware update to ultimately fail.Once I have created some kind of adapter that will allow me to convert the ear cups to aftermarket over ear foam pads instead the included on ear pads, they'll be perfect for me and my limited use case.","Reviewed in the United States December 12, 2020",AHZZCKWWWKOAWONQQV5CZL7JGJVQ,TRUE,4,Style: OriginalColor: Black

This, combined with...- The enclosures are not isolated at all, sonically. Which means that it can't be heard over the train I ride where I live, which is not hard for most headphones with good volume and isolation. That can be also compensated for by good noise cancellation. But unfortunately...- The noise cancellation blows. And of course, it's pretty useless if all the noise is just leaking in and drowning out the sound of the headphones anyways.- If you pair these with two devices, like your phone and laptop, and then walk out of the house....the headphones will warn you via voice that you have lost connection. Over, and over, and over, and over....perpetually, until you actually turn them off and turn them back on, re-pair with the device near you only. To confirm this I once let it warn me I had been disconnected from my laptop for a solid 15 minutes.- If you're paired with two devices, the headphones will often simple refuse to play sound from one of the devices, despite showing as still paired. This also requires a shutdown/re-pair with ONLY your desired device.- Also, sometimes on my Macbook Pro M1, they just don't make any sound. Paired alone, selected as the OS audio output...and it clicks once when sound is supposed to play and then does nothing. I still haven't found a good fix for this other than rebooting, shutting of and re-pairing the headphones.

I have big ears, but they fit me without issues; I can wear them for hours without feeling tired or touching the drivers inside the earcups. I have worn them for 6+ hours with computer glasses without feeling sore.- Amazing noise isolation; I do not see a reason to activate the noise canceling; the result with and without NC is very similar.- Battery level is more than enough to charge it once per week, 60h = 8.5h per day (with noise canceling off)- Includes free software to change the EQ settings to your liking. You can either use the 20+ presets included or configure everything manually.- Bluetooth connectivity means no dongle is required to connect them to modern computers, phones, or tablets. Making them portable and easy to set up. Much better than 2.4GHz dongles.- Bluetooth connectivity has been 100% reliable. I haven't experienced glitches or disconnects during normal use with three different devices.- Bluetooth range is about 10 meters (~30 ft) away from the device with multiple walls in between.- Dual Bluetooth connection, you can connect them with one device, say PC, and to your phone. Only one device can stream audio, but you can listen to music on your PC and quickly switch to your phone to take a call.- Includes a microphone to pick up your voice. It is nothing to write home about, but it is functional with noise-canceling software. Enough for a Zoom/Teams call.- The headset has voice notifications for battery level, noise canceling mode, power on, power off, and Bluetooth connected/disconnected. I always know what is going on.- USB-C and 3.5mm jack compatible.- All controls are located on the right earcup and have a very intuitive and easy-to-identify layout. In a day or two, you will feel familiar with it and won't need to look at them to know what you are pressing.(Small) CONS:- Noise isolation is so good that you get that awkward feeling of listening to your internal body sounds, like breathing. Similar to covering your ears with your hands.- Noise isolation is excellent, but that also comes at the price of heat retention. Earcups get hot.- Noise canceling is not bad but gives me a weird sensation when it is on, like pressure on my eardrums, similar to being on a plane. Not sure if this is applicable to all noise-canceling devices out there.- The microphone to pick up your voice is functional if used with software noise-canceling, but no one will praise the quality of your voice on the other side of the call.- The volume level is always configured to 100% the first time the headphones are connected to a new device; afterward, the volume level will be remembered. In the first week, I almost blew off my eardrums two times. Now I know better 😉.- This is very subjective, but regardless of EQ configuration, the sound is a bit dull compared to bigger headphones/headsets. Somehow it feels less rich and colorful.- This is not a CON for the price, but I wish they included a case to carry them everywhere.- This is not a CON for me, but it may be for you. I am a male with what I consider a large head, yet I use the headphones at the minimum band size without expanding it.

I've been using them for a couple of days, and so far, everything's been great.They look really cute! If you're looking for aesthetic and cute headphones for photos, these definitely fit that vibe!Sound quality: 10/10The sound quality is really good. I'm not particular about my preferences, but I can say these sound just as good as my Airpods. They don't really leak sound unless you're blasting the volume. At 50%, there's a slight amount of leak, but you wouldn't be able to hear it unless you're standing really close to the headphones and it's super quiet around. So, if you're looking to use these in public or at a gym, you should have no worries! The noise-canceling feature also helps with blocking out background noises so you wouldn't really need to blast the volume to hear the music clearly. The leakage is more obvious at 75% and above.Noise-canceling: 10/10I've never used noise-canceling headphones before, so I can't say too much about that, but I do notice that the headphones themselves on normal mode are already pretty decent in blocking out noises, and the noise-canceling mode blocks out almost everything (I couldn't even hear myself so if that helps!) There's also a transparency mode that lets in a little bit of the surroundings in case you want to be able to hear if someone calls out to you or something, but personally, I don't see too much of a difference between that one and the normal mode.Battery and comfort: 10/10Since opening the box, I haven't had to charge these, and I've been using them for 3 days with a couple of hours of listening each time, so the battery definitely lasts. They also sit really comfortably, and my head/ears don't hurt at all, even after hours of wearing them.Last notes:I don't know if people care about this, but I definitely did, so I'll share my thoughts in case anyone wants to know. These do have an indicator light when you turn them on. The light flashes when it is finding a device to connect to, but the light will turn off once you start playing music! I hate when headphones or earbuds flash during use since it makes them look cheap, so this is great that the light turns off. Regarding the sound core app, the 2 devices connecting feature, and the built-in mic, I don't really use any of those, so I don't have anything to say about those, but it's nice to know that those are there.Overall, 100% would recommend!

I find them comfortable to wear around the house while I clean or work, and they do well while walking around (although they are likely to slip if you bend down super quickly or try to lay down, but honestly at that point I think it's okay to just take them off for a bit or switch to a different listening device because I doubt many headphones are truly non-slip when put to the same tests) and I wore them on two recent flights without issue. The only feature I haven't tested is the noise cancellation, so I'd recommend looking through other reviews for comments on this feature.Overall this was a win for me. These headphones are not overly bulky or unattractive, and they sound great for the price. The Bluetooth connectivity works wonderfully and the battery life is crazy good. I used them for about two weeks off and on without needing to recharge. Even five to six hours of constant use really only used about 10% of the overall battery life.","Reviewed in the United States July 30, 2024",AHRWVV5VVBTM7UXBWOCEX2OZMK4A,TRUE,0,Color: WHITE
R1LNE1C8CALI5I,B0CQXMXJC5,5.0 out of 5 stars Surprisingly Awesome!,the Chaos Coordiator,5,"So, I was somewhat skeptical about buying these. I mean, $50 headphones from Amazon? But, I had a flight with a screaming baby. The poor baby and mom were just miserable and trying everything, but the baby could not be soothed. 4 hours later, I would have paid my neighbor sleeping soundlessly ANYTHING for 5 minutes with his head phones. Needless to say, something had to be done before my next flight. I had no desire to spend millions on headphones and these had decent reviews so I thought I would at least give them a try before making the investment in the Apple or Bose headphones.I have been so happy with these I had to get online and share. Now, remember that my expectations were low, but the noise cancellation works pretty well on these. Are they perfect, no, but are they pretty great, totally! I have kind of a big head, so often times headphones pinch a bit, but these are really comfortable. I charged them fully before my first flight and have legitimately not charged them again for three weeks. I don’t use them all day every day, but I have probably used them for 16 hours of listening and they still say that they have medium battery. Overall, I would buy these again in a heart beat!! I highly recommend.","Reviewed in the United States July 28, 2024",AHL5JY6GDZ7W3FTZIH3FTJTIHOLQ,TRUE,0,Color: WHITE
R1KQ6L65B86LHU,B0CQXMXJC5,4.0 out of 5 stars Exceptional Sound Quality and Unmatched Comfort - Soundcore Q20i,Alberto Castillo Correa,4,"The Soundcore Q20i headphones are simply impressive. Since I received them, they have exceeded all my expectations in terms of sound quality and comfort.Sound Quality: The active noise cancellation is fantastic, effectively blocking out ambient noise and allowing me to fully immerse myself in my music or podcast. The bass is deep and resonant without being overwhelming, while the highs are clear and crisp. Whether I'm listening to classical music, rock, or podcasts, the audio quality is always excellent.Comfort: The headphone design is very ergonomic. The memory foam ear pads are soft and fit my ears perfectly, allowing me to wear them for hours without discomfort. Additionally, the adjustable headband feels robust, ensuring a perfect fit.Battery Life: The battery is another strong point. With a single charge, I can use the headphones for several days without worrying about recharging them. The fast charging feature is extremely useful for those moments when I need a quick battery boost.Additional Features: The built-in controls on the headphones are intuitive and easy to use. The Bluetooth connection is stable and quick, with no interruptions or signal drops. Additionally, the built-in microphone offers clear and noise-free call quality.Conclusion: The Soundcore Q20i headphones are an excellent investment for anyone looking for high-quality headphones with active noise cancellation. They offer a superior listening experience and comfort that allows for long usage sessions without discomfort.

But after reading the reviews I decided to go ahead as they were more than half the cost of name brand headphones. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and the comfort that these headphones have. It was so easy to use the blue tooth with my new Sony Bravia OLED I just purchased. My wife goes to bed a lot earlier than me and I love my action movies. But with the loud explosions and noises associated with these films, I didn't want to use the surround sound and these headphones have a very good quality speaker system.

Sound quality is pretty good, the EQ app seems somewhat lacking in control for custom EQ, but the loaded sound profiles are plenty and easy to dial in for different uses.Battery life lasted two 3 hour plane trips and 3-4 days of 2 hours a day use without needing to be recharged.

The noise canceling seems just as good. The phones are way lighter. The audio settings and equalizer are adequate (although I haven't found a balance setting which I kinda need for hearing issues). You can connect 2 devices at the same time. The Bluetooth connection range is actually greater than the Philips. Pretty much the same options as the more expensive phones.

With these, the noise canceling cuts about 80% of that noise, and you can easily hear people on the phone. The closed ear design helps too. Pairing with my iPhone took all of 1 minute, and it can pair to 2 phones, so I can use either my personal or work phone. The cusions are ultra soft and comfy.Minor complaint is that these are fairly heavy, and they are on the looser side. They stay on my head most of the time, but leaning over they can fall off.Music sound quality is good, although I don't use them for that.The app is not needed and only has a few functions. It lets you turn off the bass boost, which is on by default, and is not ideal for voice calls.Buttons are simple, easy to use, easy to find by feel.Now, I don't really know if the noise cancelling feature *really* does cut down the SPL that goes into my ears, nor if it actually does fully protect my hearing. I do know that after about an hour in the noisy data center, I had no ringing or other signs of over exposure. I also know that even without the artificial noise reduction, the closed cups do offer some noise reduction.Overall, pleased with these for the limited purpose that I use them for, definitely worth it.","Reviewed in the United States February 27, 2024",AFLWOURM224KDYDN6VM3ZP7YU5VA,TRUE,4,Color: BLACK

R1A1PVIQGXUYMQ,B0CQXMXJC5,3.0 out of 5 stars These have been decent,jayBlueJay,3,"Update 7/28/24 -- Everything below still applies and overall I still like them and use them every day. But, this has become pretty irritating: the ""connects to 2 devices simultaneously"" is only so-so. You don't have to unpair them from your computer to pair them to your phone- which is convenient. However, the headphones often ""forget"" what they were connected to, and you have to manually reconnect them (but not re-pair them) after powering them up. I also have noticed audio ""skipping"" sometimes if they're connected to my phone & Mac at the same time, so you ultimately have to disconnect the headphones from the second device anyway.These headphones have great sound quality: they aren't Bose quality- but I'd put them on par with some of Sony's mid-range products, which usually cost around 30-40% more. The bass is great, and they have a good overall range. The battery life is outstanding - I use these for appointments, committee meetings, phone calls, music, and podcasts. I'd say on average I use them about 2 hours per day, with noise-cancelling on that entire time, and I only charge them about every other week. They are also incredibly comfortable, with soft leather or leather-like ear pads and a padded band that goes over your head. Here are a few small complaints that keep it from being 5 stars: First, the time it takes to turn them on- it takes about 3s of holding the button to turn them on. Then, they make a ""whoosh"" sound effect, a sort of ""beep"" to let you know they are connected, and they announce the battery level. All of this takes about 8 seconds or so, which isn't long but enough to make you miss part of your podcast if you don't pause it before turning them on- not a big deal, but worth mentioning. Other reviews are correct about these not being for working out- the band and its padding are comfortable but slick. These would absolutely fall off during any exercise that involves bending forward or backward (e.g. sit-ups). They also get a little warm on your ears (not from the electronics, just the warmth of the padding/leather material), which also makes them less-ideal for working out. Lastly, I like that the voice says ""transparency,"" ""normal,"" or ""noise-cancelling"" when you change modes- but my GOD it's loud. A woman's voice will practically shout over your music or podcast to announce ""NOISE CANCELLING"" when you press the button. If the app let you adjust the voice volume, this would be a non-issue, so hopefully a future software update will fix this. These small complaints aside, I very much enjoy these and will one day upgrade to an Anker Soundcore set of water-resistant headphones.","Reviewed in the United States February 26, 2024",AHHP3QK7L5ECWHDLQNAFDJ4OHYWA,TRUE,0,Color: BLUE

The reason I feel compelled to write a review right away is that these headphones are exactly what I was looking for as someone who prioritizes comfort. I have a pair of Bose QC35s, but after an incident tripping over the charging cord, the noise cancelation in one ear doesn't work correctly. I tried Sony's XM4s, but ended up selling them after accepting they were uncomfortably tight on my oversized watermelon of a head.This leads me to need some replacement noise-canceling headphones for work, and not being in the mood to spend another $200-300, as I also had a pair of AirPods Pros bite the dust on a bike ride. In searching for budget options, these Soundcore Q20i headphones caught my eye due to good experiences with Anker stuff and the fact they clearly seem to be taking inspiration from Bose. I waffled but finally pulled the trigger due to a flash sale, paying about $40.I'm so glad I did. These are every bit as comfortable on my planetary noggin as the much more expensive QC35s and the noise canceling is better than I expected, though my standards aren't too high for that. The actual audio quality is meh, but they're pleasing. I'd say the sound quality is similar to good but basic earbuds, like Airpods or the standard wired Apple earbuds. Not even close to audiophile, but perfectly fine for all sorts of listening.If you're looking for comfortable budget over-ear noise-canceling headphones, especially if you have a big head, these are definitely worth a look.","Reviewed in the United States December 14, 2023",AG3EOI2HNIBOW7Q56L6YEK5MPERA,TRUE,4,Color: BLUE
R3TGT9LDCQ3RJ6,B0CQXMXJC5,3.0 out of 5 stars Does The Job,Bob,3,"Best aspect, they are comfortable. I've worn them for hours at a time working in the office and they don't irritate head/ears. The stock setting for sound is ""bass boost"". This is a poor setting. It makes music that has bass and lows already that are prominent, quite muddy. In the bass boost setting the driver(s) are pretty easily overdriven to give undesired distortion. If you download the app, you can turn this setting off, and it seems to clean things up pretty well.As for the noise canceling, which is the reason that I purchased these headphones (I have better headphones for enjoying music), I would say it seems to leave something to be desired. I work in a shared office space, and become easily distracted by chatter and office conversations by co-workers. A lot of the drowning or I would say average noises are quickly covered up, and minor conversations are as well. However, if someone is speaking loudly, this sound still cuts through pretty easily. Now I can turn up my white noise or music and cover up these louder noises, but this sometimes becomes a distraction within my own head when I am trying to do focused work. The noise canceling is better than the headphones I was using in the office, so I will give it that, and for the price I am still using them, which is why I would say that they ""do the job"", but there is some room for improvement.If I were to do it again, I would spend a bit more money to get some noise canceling that covered up more noise (which I have used in more expensive headphones previously).","Reviewed in the United States May 2, 2024",AEX5RMIEXA2WJFFU64DEYSJZ7A7A,TRUE,3,Color: BLACK

The sound quality randomly distorts, which I fix by disconnecting and reconnecting. This only stops it from being a painful experience, as the sound is still inconsistent and not as clean as it was at the beginning. It disconnects from my devices on a whim.

RVR2I38IHHJWP,B0CCZ1SQ8G,5.0 out of 5 stars Best Headphones,Michael Wyatt,5,"As an army combat veteran, I’ve had my fair share of experiences with equipment designed to endure the harshest conditions. When I unboxed the Bose QC45 Noise Cancelling Headphones, I felt an immediate connection—not just to the quality of the product, but also to the striking army green color that resonates deeply with my military background. It’s a hue that evokes memories of resilience, strength, and camaraderie, making these headphones not just a gadget, but a personal statement.From the moment I put them on, I was enveloped in a cocoon of serenity. The noise-cancelling technology is nothing short of revolutionary; it feels as if the world outside has been muted, allowing me to immerse myself fully in my music, podcasts, or even the soothing silence I often crave after a long day. The sound quality is breathtaking, delivering rich, nuanced audio that makes every note come alive. Whether it’s the thunderous bass of my favorite tracks or the delicate strings of a classical symphony, the QC45s handle it all with remarkable precision.Comfort is paramount, especially for someone like me who has spent countless hours in gear that can be heavy and cumbersome. The QC45s are exceptionally lightweight and feature plush ear cushions that make long listening sessions a delight rather than a chore. I’ve worn them on long flights and during extended periods of downtime, and they never fail to impress with their ergonomic design.Additionally, the battery life is phenomenal. With up to 24 hours of wireless playback, I can enjoy uninterrupted listening without the constant worry of recharging. In a world where downtime is a luxury, the Bose QC45s ensure I can savor every moment without interruption.Overall, the Bose QC45 Noise Cancelling Headphones have exceeded my expectations in every regard. They are a testament to the brand’s dedication to quality, performance, and innovation. For anyone seeking an unparalleled audio experience—whether you’re a music aficionado, a frequent traveler, or simply someone who appreciates the beauty of silence—these headphones are an invaluable addition to your arsenal. And for veterans like myself, the army green color serves as a proud reminder of our legacy, merging functionality with a touch of personal history. Highly recommended!","Reviewed in the United States August 2, 2024",AERGJKVYGFC5WPVNWBNXYBPT6U3A,TRUE,23,Color: Cypress Green
R3PEAUXF7SDQXL,B0CCZ1SQ8G,"5.0 out of 5 stars Above average, very light, great sound",Anna,5,"I’m a layperson, so let me first say I purchased these after much research but based on a “general audience’s” needs. What I mean by that, is my boyfriend mixes music, and while these are high quality this review isn’t for those types of people. This is for more layperson type of needs.1. I actually used chat gpt to compare and contrast numerous headphones based on my desires so if you’re needing help choosing that was very helpful to me.2. My needs were as follows: light, comfortable, noise cancelling, color, Bluetooth across devices, and ease of app use.3. I discovered that these headphones outdo their Sony competition specifically because they’re lighter and they don’t drop Bluetooth when you move to your computer from your phone for example. I found Sony has issues trying to switch back to your phone when on computer.Bluetooth is very important to me and a top need. I switch between devices enough for that to be a serious issue for me.4. I have a tiny head and am a 5’2 woman. I don’t have large proportions. For example my boyfriend is 6 foot with a large head and headphone weight won’t affect him the same way. For me headphones can literally be too heavy and fatiguing so my other main qualifier was that these are lighter than all but 1 of the top 7 brands out there.5. The cushion on these is shockingly luxurious and an added bonus.6. I get a mean case of sensitive ears, I always have. When I run my ears ache, in the cold my ears ache, if I am in a plane they ache. I am part of a certain population percentage (I’ve googled it’s around 30% but fact check me- this is for you though if you are like me) who have ear canals that actually can be very painful with the wrong pressure. For this reason I’m fairly picky about headphones which apply a significant amount of pressure. These headphones have not triggered this issue for me.7. I wanted good plane headphones and these will be great if I lean my head on the window area. The band doesn’t dig.8. They look really nice.9. The color options are cute10. The case is nice11. I heard for Sony there was popping on phone calls and it therefore became between these and Apple however apples are very very heavy. I ended up going with these for that reason. I have used them for numerous phone calls and haven’t had the issues, and people hear me easily and have had no issues hearing me. I did have popping once but I think it’s on the end of the person you’re on the phone with. My cousin was in his car shouting into his Bluetooth and I feel if he had been quieter it wouldn’t have happened. The popping has never occurred with music and is specific to a loud shout from someone on their own CarPlay so no biggie. Otherwise zero pop12. The noise cancelling is exceptional, I put them on and don’t play anything, but can no longer hear my AC at all. You understand generally the sound of constant AC. Like vrrrrrrrrr. It’s completely gone.13. Soothing without music to just make things less loud. Suitable for autistics who want a quieting incognito headphone that changes, also more comfy than alternative ear covers. (I am AuDHD.)14. Music can get really loud and nice lots of depth (layerperson opinion but my boyfriend said the sound quality is great and the next step up is just studio mixing headphones)15. If you wait for prime day or other sales they’re 150$ off usually (better than every other competitors prime or Black Friday deals)16. They seem durable and collapse in many ways so you can’t easily break them.17. The app has had no issues for me. Online there’s some app complaints and I have not run into them at all. The app seems to me very easy to navigate.","Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2024",AENHF6YD4RSLEPKBFSQZK3DE3LBA,TRUE,81,Color: White

As someone who values high-quality audio and effective noise cancellation, these headphones have truly impressed me.First and foremost, the noise-cancelling feature is phenomenal. Whether I’m on a busy commute, working in a noisy café, or just trying to relax at home, the Bose QuietComfort headphones create an incredibly serene listening environment. The active noise cancellation technology blocks out external sounds so effectively that it feels like I’m in my own private sound bubble.The sound quality is top-notch as well. The audio is crisp, clear, and well-balanced across all genres. Whether I’m listening to music, podcasts, or taking calls, the clarity and richness of the sound make every experience enjoyable.Comfort is another area where these headphones truly shine. The plush ear cushions and adjustable headband ensure a perfect fit for extended listening sessions. I’ve worn them for hours on end without any discomfort, which is a testament to their ergonomic design.Battery life is impressive, too. I easily get up to 24 hours of playback on a single charge, making them ideal for long flights, commutes, or extended work sessions. And if you’re in a pinch, a quick charge gives you hours of additional listening time.The Bluetooth connectivity is seamless and reliable.

Used to burn through cheaper ($100-$150 range) headphones so feel like this model is the right price to save money over time.I use these at work everyday. They block out enough noise and coffee shops and airplanes to allow you to actually watch a movie or make a call if you need to without the dialing the volume to 11. Onboard mic works well enough - no one on other end has commented on issues.I’m not an audiophile who geeks out on speaker quality, but I feel like these get the job done. I listen to a very eclectic mix of music in Spotify and I feel like the audio quality holds up between dubstep and light classical. Probably not good enough for a pro musician but more than enough for a tech bro to listen to synthwave and get into a flow-state.As long as BOSE can maintain this level of quality I’ll keep gifting this quiet comfort model to loved ones.","Reviewed in the United States July 18, 2024",AHMHOXH3CWWGXYTBHAUO2RA66YTQ,TRUE,20,Color: Moonstone Blue

It took a while to wrap my head around all its features, but once I figured it out, I LOVED IT. I paired the them with both my PC and iPhone, and the accompanying app is awesome, allowing me to connect to both devices simultaneously. This feature is a real game changer, making it so much easier to switch between my PC and phone without any hassle.The noise cancellation is comparable to my AirPods, but these headphones make it much easier to coordinate between devices, especially my PC. The sound quality is excellent, and the comfort level is top-notch, even during long listening sessions. The build quality feels premium, and the controls are intuitive once you get used to them.I was on the fence about purchasing these headphones since they are on the pricier side, but I'm glad I bought them.

ROG20CQUWLEBQ,B0CCZ1SQ8G,"4.0 out of 5 stars Wonderful sound quality, somewhat flimsy",VM Express,4,"I've had these Bose QuietComfort NC Headphones for about a month now, and I really like how they feel and sound. For context, I have tried out about 5 different pairs in the last 6 years, starting with some Plantronics PRO's back in 2017, which i still use occasionally for travel. Then I moved to some Sony ones which I did not like. All of these other headphones were wireless and noise cancelling in the $100 to $150 range. They each had some shortfall that made them hard to use. Honestly out of all my previous headphoen the Plantronics were the best in quality and durability and Battery life. Sony always had connectivity issues and would crash randomly. Even the mid range model WHCH710N which had a lot of issues. They would randomly crash during zoom calls or listening to music. Happened about 3-4 times a week, it was getting really annoying.I decided to tier up my headphones because I use them for work daily. I thought it was a worth while investment. I decided to go with Bose because of the name recognition and because I have seen many of my peers use them (Im a Software Engineer).My first impressions of the Bose headphones were :- Light- Easy to setup - reliable bluetooth connection (something Sony was lacking)- Excellent sound quality (Best sound quality - on par and slightly better than my Plantronics)- Comfortable (The most comfortable out of all the other headphones I've used)To elaborate further. A common pain point I've experienced is difficulty pairing and dealing with unstable bluetooth connections with my other headphones. I rightfully assumed that this was a price point issue, because I have not had that problem with the Bose headphones. The Bose headphones were easy to setup, they also have apps to help with it. But you can use them without any apps.They are very comfortable and fairly light, comparing to others i've used. I sometimes wear these for 6-10 hours a day and I never have that weird ear pain that you can develop from wearing headphones for long. I have very big ears so that is saying something.Sound quality is excellent. Deep bass with excellent sound range, very satisfying to listen to. They also have a great volume range. This is what Bose is known for so they definitely get this right.CON 1:They do feel rather flimsy. For this price point I expected more metal parts. The materials look well made and have excellent form factor. The headphones however are completely plastic from what I can tell. I feel like one good tug would snap the hinges on the ear pieces. This is a serious concern when you're wearing lose clothing or a hoodie. The headphone could get caught in the folds of your clothing and if were to pull hard or fast while going through the motions you might break them. I have no data to back this up obviously because I am not going to throw away perfectly good headphones to test that theory but you can sort of tell by holding them and pulling on them a little.CON 2:Battery life isn't great. If I forget to turn them off at the end of my work day they somehow continue to deplete the battery. The following morning they are already at 50% battery. So that is 50% a day with only 6-8 hours of actual work (active use). For reference, my old Plantronics headphones last for several days without needing a recharge. I have gone on to use them for 5+ days without having to charge them. Even the mid-range Sony headphones perform ""slightly"" better than this. I know it's good practice to turn them off after you're done but one forgets to do that far more often than one would think. There is room for improvement here.Overall i'd say these are excellent headphones with great sound quality and form factor. Do take a little extra care because they are not the most durable headphones out there.

R1CKN589J52EL5,B0CCZ1SQ8G,5.0 out of 5 stars Quiet and (mostly) comfortable indeed.,Reviewer MHM 3-5,5,"This is my first pair of Bose headphones. Initial impressions before even putting them on was “Dang, these are expensive headphones,” and at $349.99, yes, they are. There’s hundreds of headphones on the market, many of them with noise cancelling, that are available for far less money. But, considering my first pair of ANC Headphones were the original Beats by Dr. Dre Studios, and adjusted for inflation since 2011, I paid $416 for those, these are certainly more than competitive. Also, there’s a reason that for the past several years, when people bring up noise cancelling headphones, they are usually talking about Sony or Bose as their reference point. They are quality. They do the job well. Let’s dive in.1. ANC2. Comfort3. Sound4. Build Quality5. Feature Set6. Who should buy these?Ok, so as I said, my previous ANC Headphones are the original Beats Studios, and my most recent over the ear headphones purchase was the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x back in 2017. I’ll be comparing these to my experience with the both of them. Maybe also in comparison to my gaming headset, the Razer Barracuda X.First off, the noise cancelling itself, since this lineup is called QUIETComfort. Pretty darn good. Honestly, I can’t say that it’s any better than my reference point of headphones from 2011, but still positive experience. Blocks out basically all voices (except the higher range like baby cries), and I couldn’t hear any other noise around me when in use. Can’t complain.Now for the QuietCOMFORT portion of the equation. Compared to both of my previous headphones, it’s a serious improvement. The Beats and Audio-Technica both were heavy over the top of my skull, creating discomfort over extensive sessions where I would shift the band forward and backward over my head to give a break to the affected area. My Razer Barracuda X are also lightweight, and up to this point were the most comfortable in this regards, but the Bose definitely have more padding on the band. That said, I still have experienced the same over the skull discomfort with these headphones, and the band has to be loosened to address it. Obviously, that means the headphones overall sit more loosely on my head and are less secure.The earcups have sufficient padding for my ears, and they don’t make contact, so though they are shallow, they aren’t as shallow as others I’ve owned where the speaker housings press against the outer cartilage of my ear. This, again makes for a comfortable experience over time. Like other headphones I’ve owned, definitely heat buildup inside the earcups, and these are no exception, with condensation gathering on the material. Yep, I was sweaty listening to these. But I live in the desert, so there’s that. Your experience may vary based on your location and if you run generally warm or not.The sound quality over playback is pleasant, and anything I’ve found unpleasant I can adjust easily with the Bose app to tune the EQ to my liking. I blame anything I haven’t liked to my various EQ settings (iOS, Spotify, Bose app combinations) and the source of the audio (Spotify streaming) more than the quality of the sound itself. Both my ATH-M50x and Barracuda X have mostly neutral sound, with the ATH being legitimate studio monitors being only slightly warm and the Barracuda having neutral with slight emphasis to bass for obvious reasons: gaming you want to hear footsteps, and higher bass emphasis aids immersion in game. Obviously, the Beats were very warm, and had bass emphasized beyond the Barracudas. So if I were to place the Bose in the comparison, I’d say its default sound is warm, not neutral, but definitely not as bass heavy as anything Beats put out in 2011 (and from what I read, remains bass heavy in the present). These aren’t studio monitors or reference headphones or audiophile headphones. They’re meant to just make your music sound good with little fuss, with the ability to tune to your liking. If you want audiophile headphones, neither Bose nor Sony nor Beats offerings in this segment meet that criteria. If you want bass heavy headphones, Bose, Sony, JBL have extensive options in that regards at several price points. As already stated, this meets the middle ground between neutral and bass emphasized. It’s warm out of the box, but not at the detriment of the rest of the range. Everything from low to high is clear and crisp. Nothing is overly harsh.Build quality is a little bit of a concern of mine. It’s very hard to find a set of headphones not made entirely out of plastic and no exception here. The inherent design of my OG Beats, though also loaded with plastic, felt sturdier, but the only moving points on those were the hinges, and to a far lesser degree, the cups moved on slight swivels to lay flat on your head. So it makes sense that they’d feel sturdy when there wasn’t a lot of pivot and rotation points. On these, the headphones have folding and rotating ear cups, and at all points across the build, there feels like there’s flex in it. I worry very much that my toddler or baby would get a hold of them and twist them to pieces. I don’t have that concern with either my Audio-Technica headphones, also mostly plastic, nor the Corsair gaming headset my toddler uses for his drum kit, which gets tossed around, stepped on, kicked around, and keeps on going just fine. But, as previously stated, the material choice keeps weight down, which keeps comfort high, like my Barracuda X. Both have lots of lightweight plastic. Both need to be kept away from kids that don’t know how to treat things with delicate touch. Though I know people do go for a run or workout with these, I wouldn’t recommend it. I don’t know if they’d survive a fall, and they’re not IPX rated anyhow against sweat or other moisture. Seriously, get some IPX rated headphones or use some earbuds for sweaty, motion filled sessions. Keep these for the office, study, travel, and everyday listening. With that said, these still feel like a premium product. They don’t feel cheap. I’m just leveling with anyone that is considering these of what their limitations may be.Feature set for these is quite extensive, and y’all can do your research on every last bit. Will just point out some things I was curious about when I purchased these.- The ANC has two presets: Quiet and Aware. You can craft your own presets in the app, and adjust them based on your liking and whether or not you think you’ll encounter wind. So far I find these basically pointless. I don't need to fine tune how much ANC I have. I either want to hear things, or don't.- The app also supports any firmware updates and allows you to tune your EQ to your liking. I can’t stand that there’s multiple Bose apps. I use one for these headphones and one for my Soundlink Flex. I really wish Bose would consolidate all their consumer, portable audio (meaning headphones, earbuds, and travel speakers) into one app. I don’t know why I need two apps for devices that both come and go with me. I’d be more forgiving of multiple apps along portable products versus home products (such as in-wall speakers and home theater speakers). It's especially confusing when the Soundlink Flex MAX is in the Bose Music app with the QuietComforts, but the Soundlink Flex is not. So weird, so pointless. Anyhow, I digress.- Like all QC lineups, these headphones also support analog playback over a traditional cable. They also all feature an asymmetric plug arrangement, 2.5mm on one end and 3.5mm on the other. Unlike the more expensive QuietComfort Ultras, this pair of headphones I’m reviewing allows for passive playback. If you run out of charge or are preserving charge, you can still use these without ANC and listen over the cable. And it has in-line mic as well. This gives you far more flexibility than the Ultras, and allows these headphones to serve double duty as an in-a-pinch gaming headset for an Xbox controller, and to continue to support phone calls, etc. through the in-line microphone even if you cannot or choose not to power them on. I cannot believe that Bose’s flagship product, the Ultras, do not offer that same versatility. This product would be even better if you could use these speakers powered but without ANC features (quiet or aware) enabled to conserve battery power, but retain the convenience of wireless.- Driver size is 35mm to the Ultras 40mm. My ATH-M50x, aptly named, are closer to 50mm drivers, and I believe the Barracuda X are 40mm or so. But the playback volume on the Bose seems louder and, obviously is more versatile than my analog only ATH-M50x comparison. The Barracuda, also wireless, are still less versatile in that they require the USB-C dongle or the analog cable to function, and lack ANC. Bluetooth 5+ is just far more versatile, even if it has latency that the aforementioned devices do not.- Main differences between these and the Ultras include the driver size (Ultra is larger), the amount of microphones used for ANC (the Ultra has more), the inclusion of Immersive Audio on the Ultras (like Spatial Audio on Apple… I’m honestly not sold by that at this time), battery life (these are longer than the Ultra), and the physical structure of them differ. These are just another rehash of the QC35, QC45 design, the Ultras are unique in their structure.They arrived at 60% charge and I listened to them for about 30 minutes before placing them on a USB-C charger. Within an hour I was at 100%. Could’ve been quicker. Idk. Was in the backyard playing with the kiddos and listening to the Bose Soundlink Flex (go buy one of those, I’d recommend that to anybody).So, who are these headphones for? A lot of people, but let’s face it, $349.99 will price out a lot of buyers. I’d recommend my existing ATH-M50x to people that want to spend under $200 and only care about reliable sound. I’d recommend Sony ULT ANC Headphones for people with $200 to spend that want ANC and plan on listening to Pop, Hip-Hop, EDM (their ANC is nearly as good as XM5, Sony’s competitor to these Bose… but they’re very bass heavy). I’d recommend Audio-Technica again to people with a budget of $100.These are a luxury product. I’m aware that there are headphones far more expensive than these. But these are still expensive to many people. At this price point, I’d expect no less than 5 years of usage, and as I’ve already stated, I’ve used $150 headphones for 7 years now. So with that said, a couple of points of advice to someone weighing investing into these:- These go on sale periodically down to $249.99. At that price, they’re still premium, but far more competitive against the likes of Sony XM5 and Apple AirPods Max.- Bose Refurbished is a great option. The warranty is exactly the same as the brand new product, and you save money. I’ve done just that with my Soundlink Flex and have been so happy. I’m doing it again with the QuietComfort Ultras, which I snagged at $259.99, instead of their new list price of $429.99.Okay, enough money talk. Back to who these are for. If you made it this far, the $249.99-$349.99 is obviously something you’re considering as a fair value.So with that said, if you are a professional or student that wants to block out the noise around you for hours on end so you can work, these are for you.If you use public transport and want headphones to help you escape the noise, these are for you. Just, uh, be aware of your surroundings. Ya know, be safe. Yadda yadda.If you want legendary ANC, comfort, sound quality as you go through the airport and on your plane, these are for you.If you want some good headphones for the gym, I’d say you won’t be disappointed, but I’d encourage you to do some research for other headphones before you make a plan to routinely sweat into or potentially toss about headphones that are not made for either.If you’re the type of parent that wants to spoil your kid with great headphones, I’d say keep looking unless you find your child as responsible and respectful as a grown adult. I would certainly have broken these as a kid, and maybe even as a teen out of negligence (i.e. tossing my loaded backpack around or something and accidentally smashing something inside or nearby, hard case or not). There are many great headphones out there for less money, and some that are more sturdy. If you want to bless your child that way, do some serious research first, amongst serious review websites that breakdown sound quality, build quality, etc.Wow, look at you! You made it through my Amazon novel! I mean review. Yeah, that's what I meant. Hope it gave you some things to think about as you find the perfect headphones for you.

RTOEPK2F01IIV,B0CCZ1SQ8G,"4.0 out of 5 stars Bose is, as usual, worth the (on sale) price",Miss History,4,"There's just something about Bose quality and design. These headphones are perfect if you're looking for good sound quality, excellent noise cancelling, and--maybe most importantly for me--comfort. I don't know how they did it, but these really are crazy comfy to wear. They have a snug fit to boost sound quality and noise blocking, but they aren't tight at all and have a very nice, cushiony feel. I inevitably get headaches from wearing any other over-ear headphones for very long, but I've gone hours with these on my head and almost forgotten they're even there. I also like that they're not super-duper big and ostentatious. I'm not looking to wear these as a loud fashion statement and I like how sleek they are as-is. And I love the way they fold up to fit in their nice little case. It's the least awkward folding-of-headphones I've seen so far.I'm not an aficionado when it comes to sound quality, but I can tell you from personal experience and preference that the quality on these is great. Not the best out there, since, hey, you're not paying $600+ for these, but excellent nonetheless for me. You do have to have the volume up a bit to get the really epic listening experience, but that's no different from other over-ear headphones I've owned. The connected app is a no-frills affair that lets you adjust the sound a bit to your liking, and you can create additional listening modes with your preferred EQ, but I've been happy with the as-is modes already programmed into it. Set up with the app was blessedly uneventful. It connected on the first try and I've never had a bit of trouble connected new devices to my headphones. Glorious.Let's talk noise-cancelling. When that switch is flipped, the world outside your headphones is gone. It doesn't feel unnatural like you're sitting in a vacuum, but it does let you happily escape all the noisy distractions around you and just enjoy whatever you're listening to at whatever volume you prefer. I have to formally announce to anyone else home that I'm putting my headphones on because, aside from physically touching me or doing some acrobatics in my direct line of sight, I can't hear them at all if they're trying to get my attention--which, obviously, I love. Kind of the point of noise cancelling, right?The design of the headphones is simple and to the point in terms of controls. The last two pair of headphones I owned before these had awkwardly placed buttons for volume and pausing. I would always fumble to find them even after owning them for years. The controls on these Bose headphones are somehow placed just perfectly, and my fingers land on them on the first try every time. It's a little thing since a lot of us use our phones or smart watches to change the song and what not, but when I really am immersed and want to leave all distractions aside, using the controls on the headphones is a nice little treat, and that lack of fumbling to find them goes a long way to allowing me to stay in that happy and calm little headspace.I want to give these five stars for the price I paid (which, btw, was a sale price of 249.99 USD), but there's a couple of small, intertwined drawbacks for me that puts them at between a 4 and 4.5: the battery life and the power toggle/slider. The battery life is, in a word, fine. My previous headphones went for weeks of sporadic, casual listening without me needing to charge them, but they weren't as fancy and they weren't noise-cancelling. These Bose headphones need fairly regular charging, which isn't the end of the world, especially since--I assume--they use up more battery thanks to the awesomely effective noise-cancelling. It will last a long airplane trip but you'll need to charge it pretty soon after that or else you're going to be sans-headphones for at least part of the flight home.Then there's the power toggle. In general, I love this little toggle/slider. It's nothing but a tiny, silly, minor inconvenience, but I'm not a fan of the hold-this-for-a-little-while power buttons that also double as the button you need to activate Bluetooth/Bluetooth pairing. I always feel like an idiot when it's time to pair a new device to it and I can't figure out if I need to triple press the power button or what. A nice, small and easily accessible toggle/slider to turn the headphones on and off? Fantastic.The downside? You sure as heck better remember to turn the headphones off when you're not using them or they're going to remain on until the battery dies. In my experience, with that all-powerful toggle there is no automatic powering off if you leave the headphones out of use for an extended period of time. It will just drain that battery until the headphones are dead. It's a simple solution--just remember to scoot that slider to off when you're done with them! But, lamentably, I'm super forgetful and easily distracted, and some of you might be the same. I've now accidentally left my headphones on three times, and even though it is my fault, I've been pretty bummed that my headphones are totally dead when I pull them out again after that moment of forgetfulness. The automatic powering off after inactivity in my previous headphones is the one feature that I really, really miss. Is this a dealbreaker? Would I go back to those headphones because of this? Absolutely not. But from one concerned, forgetful listener to another, just remember to manually power down, even if you think you're only going to be stepping away from your headphones for two seconds :)Would I buy these again? In a heartbeat, but I probably won't need to. I've had them for seven months now but, if they're anything like the Bose speakers I've owned, they're going to last me a lot longer yet. Would I pay the full 350 USD price for them? Maybe. I got mine on sale, and they were even cheaper during Prime Day 2024. They're an awesome set of headphones, but if the price is still a little steep for you, maybe add them to your list and keep an eye on it. Bose products tend to go on sale periodically for much better discounts than, say, Apple products, especially around the holiday season.","Reviewed in the United States July 26, 2024",AHVOHVELL2RNLNFZWLVM3UY2OH3A,TRUE,1,Color: Black
RUR84RZ9061M0,B0CCZ1SQ8G,5.0 out of 5 stars ANC HEADPHONE COMPARISON: BOSE QUIETCOMFORT / 1MORE SONOFLOW / BEATS SOLO PRO / AIR PODS PRO,ITMCT,5,"I’ve owned & extensively used the Beats Solo Pros & Air Pods Pros. I gave the Beats to my daughter as the ‘on-the-ear’ design was causing me pain on flights. I migrated to the AirPods Pros hoping I’d get similar performance to the Beats with more comfort and less bulk on flights. Ultimately, the Air Pods Pros just won’t stay in my ears and the ANC just isn’t as effective due to the lack of ear covers or better plugs. So recently I ordered the new Bose QuietComforts and the 1More Sonoflows to compare. I was hopeful on the 1More product due to being on sale for $67 and that the price savings would outweigh any deficits. But ultimately I am going with the Bose QCs. This is my personal opinion and what works best for me. Keep in mind I have not extensively tested the Bose or 1More yet, but spent a day alternating between the two so this is based on initial impressions. Categories are in personal order of importance.COMFORT/DESIGN: I gave up the Beats due to pain/pressure from prolonged use of the on the ear cups. I am also not a fan of the Air Pods Pro design, nor getting them to fit in my ears well and stay (I love the original air pods, and I’ve tried multiple buds for the Pros). I have a large head so the Beats had to be fully extended to be on my head properly which probably increased pressure. They fit my adult daughter much better. The Bose QCs don’t require full extension on me, completely cover my ears, and the cups are really soft. The 1More product covers completely, and is comfortable, but heavier & puts more pressure around my ears than the Bose, so I’m skeptical if I’d want to wear them more than an hour or so. The pressure is a drawback especially given the ANC performance noted next.RANKING: Bose QC > 1More Sonoflow > Beats SoloPro > Air Pods ProANC: In my immediate comparison of the Bose QCs and the 1More Sonoflow, there was a large difference in noise cancellation. I use an infrared heater in my office sometimes that is pretty noisy. Comparable to airplane noise but quieter. The Bose is very effective against it despite fitting looser than the 1More product. But the Bose has less options than the Beats for ANC modes and I found the Beats to be slightly better at full ANC than the Bose and quicker to switch modes. The Air Pods are at a disadvantage here being an earbud product but they are effective and travel light. The 1More product was the worst performer on ANC for me.RANKING: Beats Solo Pro > Bose QuietComfort > Air Pods Pro > 1More Sonoflow.SOUND/EQ/APP: I always found the Beats Solo Pros to be balanced, clear, dynamic and pleasant. Integrated with Apple, they worked great though many audiophiles will complain about the lack of EQ adjustments. I liked the simplicity of them and not having to have an additional app. Same goes for the Air Pods. The Bose Sound is very good, as you would expect from Bose, and their App is simple and ok. Out of the box very good and you can tune them to preference. The 1More Product out of the box is definitely at the bottom of the pile. It had an almost metallic, chunky, machine sound to me. You can adjust them, update firmware, and tune them with the app which made the largest difference in the performance compared to the others. The app did have a neat white noise feature with some different options. It also had twice as many EQ adjustments points over the Bose. Ultimately, I enjoy the Bose sound the most followed by the Beats and AirPods and then the 1More, but once tuned all are very good, especially if ANC with music or video on an airplane are your target use.RANKING: Bose QC > Beats Solo Pro > Air Pods Pro > 1More Sonoflow.PHYSICAL FUNCTIONALITY: For me, I love the Beats functionality. Buttons are intuitive and easy to use, typical tactile Apple design. AirPods are similar. So far the Bose is ok, it’s intuitive and the buttons seem like they will be easy to learn. The 1More Sonoflow is last here. All buttons on the right side, the power button in front doubles as a function button and for me it’s awkward trying to find it on the front. The 1More is last by a bit for me here.RANKING: Beats Solo Pro > Air Pods Pro > Bose QC > 1More SonoflowCASE: Beats Case is cheap and not protective at all. AirPods are AirPods. The 1More Case fits but is a bit bulky, rounded, and the included accessory net is too small. The Bose Case is well made, stiff, protective, has a large accessory net, and is rectangular shaped. Personally I see it fitting in a carry on laptop bag or backpack much easier.RANKING: Bose QC > 1More Sonoflow > AirPods Pro > Beats Solo ProBATTERY LIFE: This is of limited importance to me. But it seems to get tons of mention in every online review you read. The headphones all have insanely long run times compared to older devices. I always charge before a trip and never seem to end up with dead devices. Charge your stuff. Not that hard.","Reviewed in the United States February 22, 2024",AHDJUVOQFM3KYWPZVTOVBIJ7ADIA,TRUE,115,Color: Cypress Green

Highly recommend for those 3 kid single moms who don't want to hear micky mouse club house no more. I mean being able to click that aware button though and interact with them when necessary is pretty golden. Definitely get to know your settings and where your EQ is located and play around with your settings because I definitely don't listen to a good jam with drums and bass at the same settings as I would some, pink floid, jamiroquai, sia, morgan wailen. You could but you don't have to, you can change em with the touch of a quick button. Slick. Its refreshing to have an astetic click and button sensation again instead of swiping my sony xm3s all backwards and sideways. I would go as far as saying bose puts you back in control again and I hope they never loose this feature or i will be guarding these QCs with my life. Weight is good on the head, fit is natural over the ears, only slightly protruding further than my ears. My kids can swing their arms around me and i dont get bashed i can headbang or more so nod and they dont travel. I can look down to change diapers look up to hang clothes. Rocking in my rocker on the porch and they dont budge. Only drawback i can think is they can be toasty on these hot AZ nights but over the ears in AZ kind of comes with the territory. im glad i seen washable silicone liners available.

R2F1FITP5STPE4,B0CCZ1SQ8G,"4.0 out of 5 stars So far, mostly so good",Holt,4,"I have been looking for a pair of noise cancelling headphones, and my family and friends swear by Bose. I wanted a pair for the metro, because I find that the usual earbud style of headphones can be difficult to hear on a noisy metro without cranking the volume higher than I think is probably good for regular listening. I had been looking at these headphones for a while, comparing them to other Bose products and other headphones. When they went on sale, I went for it. They are pretty easy to use, and easily connect to my phone. I wore them for most of a 33 hour journey between the US and SE Asia, and the battery I think maybe went down to 40%, so that held up very well. They are comfortable, and block the sound of a jet engine well, making it easy to hear my audio book. I have recently worn them on the noisy metro, and it was great; could keep my volume at a normal level and still hear. My only reason for not giving this a 5/5 is that, on that plane, the connection between the headphones and my phone would cut out--just for a second or so--but it did it a fair bit on the flight. It hasn't done it again since getting off the plane [at least not yet] so I am hoping it was a one-time thing, but I am a bit worried about that, especially since these were not cheap headphones, even on sale.","Reviewed in the United States August 11, 2024",AHNOAM5DAQYEKUJUVDCF3IFAQREA,TRUE,0,Color: Cypress Green
R3J47OJ199W8H6,B0CCZ1SQ8G,"3.0 out of 5 stars Pros and cons, but look elsewhere for working from home",Nathan,3,"I purchased these headphones for the purpose of working from home in a call center environment for 8hr a day. My main reasons for purchasing were: to go wireless, and increase comfort. I am often in meetings and calls for hours at a time, and the headphones my organization provided were painful.On my first day of use, I noticed a couple issues. First issue is that on Windows and Mac the microphone volume is far too low. Nobody on Microsoft Teams or my call center software could hear me. I needed to install a separate application to artificially boost the microphone by around 20dB. Second issue I noticed is regarding having two devices connected at the same time. Example: If you are actively streaming audio from a Windows computer, and then your iPhone gets a text notification, the headphones will cut the audio from the Windows computer to play the iPhone notification. When this happens, your Bluetooth connection either drops, or the audio quality gets very bad (crackling, stutters, etc) and you need to disconnect/reconnect devices.On my second day of use, I experienced random drops in audio quality and needed to power off/on the headphones 3 times.Bose has many suggestions and troubleshooting steps in their support articles, which I have gone through. That being said, these headphones are fine. I will keep them and enjoy them for my work (when they are working) and enjoy them for traveling. That being said, I do wish I would have gone with a Microsoft Teams certified device instead for my purposes. This product appears to be more intended for casual use as opposed to professional use.The sound quality is very good compared to my Sennheiser HD598. Audio is very clear, especially in the mid to high frequencies. Other reviews mention a lack of bass, but I found the bass to be MORE than enough. The active noise cancellation has a huge impact on music listening; I feel like the sound stage is very wide as I can hear many details in songs I haven't picked up on before.Noise cancellation is insanely good. I don't have a great basis for comparison, but it's almost eerie how silent the world is when you have these on. At most, I can barely hear a super loud fan a few feet away, or I barely hear the faucet when washing dishes. I look forward to using these while doing chores around the house!Comfort and fit is great for only 2 days of use. They are much more comfortable than I expected, as I have a big head and typically need to ""break in"" headphones a little bit longer. I had these headphones on for hours and they didn't give me any issues.Overall, despite the annoying connection issues I have with these things I am going to keep them. I like them enough to where I am willing to work around these issues for now. The next time I need to travel these are going to be a life saver. I can't wait to finally sleep on planes! If you're working from home, I would recommend seeking a Microsoft Teams certified pair of headphones.","Reviewed in the United States August 8, 2024",AGM4QCFYMZPGNDXBEQO4S7UZ4KQQ,TRUE,1,Color: Black
R1BS7PY9NIRGOX,B0CCZ1SQ8G,5.0 out of 5 stars Really amazing,frankfrank,5,"I have had lots of $40-60 headphones in my life and a few that did noise cancelling, and these blow them all out of the water by a huge margin.If you have some music on and noise cancelling enabled you will absolutely not hear your kids/wife in the same room unless they yell very loudly or happen to speak sharp/loud/quick at a perfect break in the music. These should be more heavily marketed to fathers everywhere to allow them to get 30 minutes of peace after work. Even without the music on it still blocks out as much noise as an average set of shooting earmuffs.In the ""aware"" mode you'll hear everything in your life just as good as you would with a single headset off your ear and the other one on, playing music.The bluetooth works great, connecting to multiple devices (phone and PC etc) at once with no foolish rules/policies that make it annoying.The other reviewers saying you have to have an app to use these are definitely wrong. You can install the app if you want extra features but you can also just pair it to your phone/tablet/pc like any other device and use it as-is. That's exactly what I did and it works great with all the standard features you would expect.Excellent hardware/buttons etc:- L side button switches between NC and ""aware"" mode, great feature to have in an easy to hit button- R side main button: single tap pauses whatever is playing, double tap jumps to next song, triple tap goes back- R side volume up and separate volume down buttons intuitively located- On button is also slide-and-hold for pairing: great feature that is impossible to do accidentally- USB-C charging- port to use hardwire cable to connect directly if you cannot understand the blueteeth thing or want to play something from a device that has no bluetooth or won't pair.Favorite feature: plug in the 2' hardwire cable (which has a tiny but good inline mic on it) and let it dangle or tuck in a shirt pocket: you now have a top quality, silent, noise cancelling headset with a good mic (without changing any mode, hitting buttons etc) that allows you to talk on the phone in bliss. Now instead of yelling at my kids to be quiet every 5 minutes that I'm on the phone, I just put these on and have a great phone call.In the small house that we live in these have made my life a lot better and allow me to let my kids run around loudly having fun at times when I just want some quiet, and when I would have otherwise made them tone it down.The only downside to know about is that these are effective enough to where you need to be careful not to use the noise cancelling when you have much going on that you need to pay attention to. For example: you would not hear your sink overflowing or a pot boiling over, I didn't hear my woodstove fire getting too hot the other day, you won't hear early warnings of kids having trouble (probably wouldn't hear choking etc but would still notice actual screaming nearby). You would still hear something break or a loud whack etc, but probably wouldn't hear a vehicle pull up in your driveway. It does to some extent take away a major ""sense"" so you can't use it as often as you might like.For those other times, like if your wife is cooking and can hear the kids for you if there is trouble, and you just want to relax, I feel like I would almost pay the purchase price of these per week that I got to use them it is so awesome.","Reviewed in the United States February 16, 2024",AHXY35FZ3NHNVNYNIINCKSNQ3G7Q,TRUE,46,Color: Black
R3F2UVXQVC15B0,B0CCZ1SQ8G,5.0 out of 5 stars I rarely write reviews... but wow!!,Kevin M.,5,"I tried 2 different cheaper pairs before returning them and buying the Bose. I immediately notice that the Bose is FAR SUPERIOR in noise canceling and quality. In the cheaper pairs, I noticed some type of 'air pressure' in my ear that the noise canceling was producing. My guess is it was some kind of standing wave to mask/hide external noise. I really don't know, because I'm not educated in this specific technology. However, I do know for sure that when I put the Bose on, I don't notice anything except the external world noises completely vanishing without a trace. Also because the Bose pair doesn't have some weird air pressure masking/hiding external noises, I can hear the music better, louder, and clearer than the other pairs.Overall just very impressed with the stark difference in quality. In some cases, cheaper is better because you can't really tell the difference. In this case, I absolutely notice the difference, and is well worth spending the extra money.","Reviewed in the United States July 18, 2024",AHH54BOSFG6XUYWEQB6WOYGC7SUA,TRUE,1,Color: Cypress Green

I can walk for 5 days - a few miles a day and still have battery power left at the end of the week. The only feature I have not used yet is the microphone adapter.Downsides are basically expense and aesthetics. I am an old man and am used to using headphones rather than earbuds. I still maintain the headphones will give superior sound quality and noise cancellation. These headphones are about 30% more expensive than the QuietComfort 45s that I purchased 2 years ago.

I put on the Bose headset and it definitely muted the stereo sound to just a faint sound. Then I tried it with the Sony and with the Sony headset you can hear it louder. It still was quiet but not as quiet as the Bose. So then I tried the new quiet comfort Bose headset and it was even more quiet.

I live near some warehouses that constantly have tractor trailers coming in and out and the noise cancellation has been a godsend for me. My current ones are getting old and looking their age so I decide to get a new one. These or even better than my old ones. They’re easy to use. I can actually set where I want the noise cancellation for different levels. Also, it’s very easy to answer my phone and talk to people while I’m listening to audiobooks. That was the only disadvantage to my old pair I could never get them to answer the phone. This one just does it with the flick of my finger on the little button on the one headphone. People say they are really expensive but to me you get what you pay for and I will gladly pay for these. My final thought is that I do not have to charge this one as often as I had to charge my old one.

The sound is fantastic too. I'm sure the Sony's are ""technically"" better or something, but what the heck is the damn point if I have to take breaks every 45 minutes to avoid a headache!Anyway, they sound great, they're very comfortable.I mostly use ""aware"" mode and it's miles better than the xm4's I used to own. I can actually hear my surroundings or if someone's trying to get my attention at work. Noise cancellation mode is pretty good too for things like yard work or whatever also.They were an impulse buy but I'm a huge fan now.I should also mention they're incredibly lightweight. REALLY good clamp without giving me a headache either.

I travel internationally, and some airlines still require the 2-prong adapter. I just purchased one separately.

Bose is what we use at the private aircraft manufacturer I work at for the headsets in all the planes. The brand itself is fudging awesome and reliable as a son of a gun. Their main focus is sound quality and background noise cancellation. I've had Beats solos (club editions, solo 3, and Beats Pro earbuds), JBL (earbuds and headphones), and I've used several other brands claiming they're the best. Music is obviously very important to me, and I'm part-time in a home office, so I use headphones for meetings and videos. The only thing I could possibly nit-pick about them is that the Beats solo 3s have a much longer battery life, but these do last all day!! And they fully charge within 8 hours MAX. Also, they come with an AUX cord, so you can connect them to your compatible devices without Bluetooth! Recently, I bought the Bose QC 45 headphones in moonstone blue (color doesn't affect the quality of sound or anything but HOLY MOLY IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL), and HOLY CRAP!! They're worth every cent, I swear by them! I slip these bad boys on (no audio) and my fan (on high) TV (on 10-15/40-50), and all chatter and other background noises get wiped out immediately. It feels like your ears get plugged. (My dad and younger sister said the same!) When you play something in them it's crisp and clean-cut audio, and you can forget about hearing anything else with them on. I'm absolutely flabbergasted, that's why I'm putting y'all on these!! The Sony WH1000s are overrated like a son of a gun. If you're gonna pay $350 for any headphones, I'm begging you to make it these!!! I'm beyond happy, and I'm so glad I decided to buy these.

R7LD05SSJMNFF,B0BKPRTRXK,4.0 out of 5 stars Nice for the price; test device compatibility before throwing away packaging,theoryofmind,4,"I have a pair of Tribit QuietPlus 72's that are starting to fall apart from daily use. I've been looking for a replacement (since they're out of stock and may or may not ever be restocked) and was thrilled to find these after hours of comparing various models.Notable aspects of this product, you decide if it's a pro or con:- very lightweight, the frame is plastic and didn't have any heft to them like I'm used to with the Tribit (personally I think they feel cheap but they're $30- they ARE cheap!)- made for smaller heads but frame does extend if needed; the Tribit frame is huge, I had to make some diy modifications, but these headphones fit me perfectly- ear cups are spacious so I would expect them to be ok if you wear earrings (except maybe hoops)- noise canceling seemed pretty decent from what I could tell. Very similar to my Tribit pair if not as good.-ear cuff padding was comfortable but I'm not sure how they'd hold up to every day wear and tear. I feel like they aren't robust enough but I also like to feel my headphones a little bit- these feel really cheap regardless of performance and I honestly would not expect them to endure an entire year of hours of daily use but I also wouldn't expect that from a $30 pair of headphones; so in that sense it would meet my expectations- controls are simple and pairing is easy *when it is compatible with the device*- these headphones paired immediately with my phone and I didn't really test them out but they sounded ok for the 10 seconds they were connected to my phoneI had to test their ability to pair with my phone because I could not get them to pair with my Samsung smart tv for anything (i wanted to be sure they could pair to begin with). I spent a good hour or more troubleshooting. My TV had the latest updates, it recognized the headphones as a BT device but refused to pair and connect with them. Looking up the problem online didn't yield any results for this specific model of headphone. I can't say with certainty if it is a fault of this product or if my TV just has an older version of BT, or what. I will say when I looked back and read the full description of these headphones they are marketed for use with MOBILE DEVICES- tablets, laptops, phones. A few reviewers have mentioned using these for watching TV but that may not literally mean using a TV, it may mean they use it to listen to movies and shows streamed through their laptop or tablet.I have had this issue with one or 2 other earbuds/headphones in the past, thankfully a rarity, so it isn't impossible or anything. There's just some kind of incompatibility with this TV and this specific model of headphones but I can't tell anything more specific than that. So even though I can't use them and I returned them in the mail the same day I received them, I'm writing this review in good faith and only rating based on what I was able to glean about this product's performance otherwise.Also my TV is a 2021 Samsung smart tv; maybe it will work on 2022 models or newer, so if you have a Samsung- be prepared to return these if need be but hopefully you'll have better luck than I did.That being said, if it works with your device, you're not going to find better for only $30","Reviewed in the United States August 24, 2023",AHRORD3W6KPSWQYHLZTSG5N7A5TQ,TRUE,46,Color: Black

I bought a second pair as a spare immediately after confirming they work and have decent battery life. My sound sensitive teen who has worn headphones pretty much every day of his life everywhere is very happy with the fit and sound. He doesn't use the powered noise cancelling.I picked up the spare pair from the cabinet because I needed something to watch movies with while in the home office while it was being an office, and immediately fell in love with them. I usually borrow my husband's expensive gaming headphones. Now I don't need them. These are awesome. I'm not a sound geek. I'm watching movies. The noise cancelling feature is amazing. I'll wear them with nothing playing, because it feels like sinking into a favorite pillow. Absolute peace. My youngest teen tried them, and now I need a pair for him, and another spare pair for when the boys fall off or down something and break theirs.""Transparent mode"" amplifies the room sounds so you can hear it over whatever is playing. When nothing else is on, they are still a sound amplifier. White noise from fans or hvac is also amplified. But it is interesting, that you can have headphones on, and look like you're lost in your own little world and not hearing the room, but secretly, you can hear better than you could without the headphones.","Reviewed in the United States August 8, 2024",AFROUMUCVL4SC5TFH4JQTTZD6BZQ,TRUE,0,Color: Black
R194BHP3AWCY6B,B0BKPRTRXK,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Sound Quality and Battery Life at a Bargain Price,ZuSu  (£цэ!#),5,"Since I live in an apartment, I use over ear Bluetooth noise canceling headphones to watch TV or listen to music on a daily basis. I have a Sony 1000-XM2 that I love, an MPow M5 and Soundcore Q20 that I gave to my mom. The Sonys are my gold standard for sound quality, but both the MPOW and Soundcore are exceptional as well.The MPow M5 finally started to physically break after 4+ years of years of near daily use, so I purchased these to replace them.I selected these because they were the among the highest rated and most purchased over ear noise canceling blue tooth headphones under $40.I received my headphones in about a couple days. The box contained the headphones, a carrying case, and cables. The build quality of the headset seems very solid with substantial earcups, a large battery between the head padding and earcups. The construction is all mat plastic with a metal leaf spring in the headband. I’m not sure if the swivel hinges are metal. ANC is controlled with a sliding switch behind the left ear while on/off, volume, skipping, pausing and pairing are controlled with three plastic push-buttons behind the right ear.When you press the buttons you hear/ feel a mechanical click that I am guessing is designed to be hepatic feedback and less intrusive than audible beeps in the headphones. Primary function of the buttons are track skipping and on/off. Holding the track buttons for a couple of seconds will allow you to control volume. This exactly the opposite of most headphones and very annoying in my opinion, as I more often want to adjust volume than skip tracks. The center (on/off) button, also allows you to pause and when held for about five seconds will put the headphones in pairing mode. As the noise canceling is on a separate slider but it does turn off with the headphones unlike other budget brands/ models. Aside from the very annoying track skipping, the controls are intuitive and reasonable.Sound quality is really good for the price. These is some punch in the bass but it isn’t overpowering. Mids and highs are clear. At the highest volumes the sound remains super clear with consistent bass. The sound quality is very good overall and exceptional at the price, better than my MPOW on par with Soundcore Q20s.Noise canceling operates as a single mode without a bypass/ ambient sound feature which is expected at this price point. Noise canceling is at least reasonably good for this price point. Low frequency noise can’t be heard, but, mid-to-high frequencies are not affected much. The sonic profile does not change with noise canceling on. Overall, noise canceling is what one can expect at this price point. If you need more mid to high frequency noise reduction, I’d recommend just getting a pair of Sony MX’s.Range is good. I can go anywhere in my apartment or even outside nearby with no loss of sound quality. Again, at this price point, I think this is expectedly good. Battery life seems insanely good. I have probably listened to 80.hours of TV and music on a single charge.The headphones have a “C” profile that curves moderately off the side of my head. I have a small to medium sized head, and I find these fit reasonably. However, they are a bit on the heavy side and the protein pads are thick and can get a little hot, though not unreasonably so.Overall I give this set extremely high marks for sound quality and battery life. Build quality, noise cancellation, and comfort are good. The only detraction I see are that that weird track skipping primary function in the controls. If I could give four and a half stars, I would, but given how Amazon reviews work, I’ll give this five stars.","Reviewed in the United States June 11, 2023",AGNQ4LZ7IDK54GIKCMDUKP5TZ35Q,TRUE,213,Color: Black

I wish the volume control was a bit better. [The little button that lets you magnify *far* sounds is interesting -- sneaky, if I wanted to listen to convos -- which I don't.] I wish these could become a bit smaller. I can't lay with them on -- they fall backwards. I don't really need them for that but if you want to use them in bed it might be an issue. (I tried using them upside down but that didn't work.) They are comfortable but after an hour I need a break. Just as well as I need to get up and stretch. Price is good but bummed to see that a week or so later there's a $7 off coupon. That said, can't complain. Hope the workers making them are getting fair wages. My only *real* complaint: When dictating, the beep in the headphones is SO SO LOUD. Like earsplitting -- even though my volume is as low as it can go while still having sound. No idea why because my earbuds don't do this. It's a real bummer though. If anyone knows a solution, I'd love it because it means I have to turn them off or take them off to dictate and I go back and forth between typing and dictating a lot. For general use, most folks should like them. How long they work is the real test.","Reviewed in the United States July 3, 2024",AHCJFHT4HRJABOOXB7LQSXBNRBQQ,TRUE,1,Color: Black

R6POJZSDKD20R,B0BKPRTRXK,"4.0 out of 5 stars From my perspective, fairly good",Gabby,4,"I just picked them up earlier today, and had used them over the time between classes. I'll break my review into 3 parts: pros, neutrals, and cons.Pros:- it's budget-friendly- fit over my ears comfortably- the cushion encompasses the entire ear and not just the outer part of the ear- the ANC works well to clarify any music you're listening to. I compared the song I was listening to without ANC, more can be heard with it on.- standard packaging, the cushioning is great for keeping the headphones in place.Neutral:- the microphone: I recorded myself reading the same article on my Beats Headphones (which are crumbling after a few years) and these headphones. Admittedly, the microphone isn't as clarifying as the sound quality on the beats, which is expected. There's a bit of this noise factor behind the words, it almost as if you were on the phone with someone that had an older android phone compared to an older iPhone.- even though the ANC is also mentioned in the pros section, I'll mention it here: for those whose ears pop fairly easily or don't enjoy the ANC because it feels weird in the eardrums, there isn't much of a difference between other NC devices I've used. However, there isn't as much of an isolating factor that puts pressure on the eardrums when the ANC is deactivated.- Type C port use: most of the newer headphones I've seen use Type B ports, and if it weren't for the fact the headphones come with the charger, finding a box could've been difficult.Cons:- though the headphones are foldable to fit in tighter spaces, it feels like there isn't enough tension so the earcuffs could stay in place until turned. It feels lose when doing so.- obviously compared to more expensive headphones, they're a bit of a downgrade.Other than that, the headphones feel alright. If you're neurodivergent and it takes time to adjust to change, the headphones don't feel so claustrophobic.","Reviewed in the United States April 18, 2024",AF3KDW34XYMIIHBNAI5ELVAM3GFQ,TRUE,3,Color: Silver

R102GELPFXM4E2,B0BKPRTRXK,4.0 out of 5 stars everything i wanted,Kara Poon,4,"Just like the Billie Eilish song, it’s pretty much everything I was looking for in headphones! I’m super happy. There are a couple areas that could use improvement, hence the star rating; but these things don’t matter to me so I love them.Sound: 5/5, clear and high quality to me as a regular person/analogue instrumental musician.Comfort: 4.5/5, the pads fit around my whole ear and don’t squeeze them even with glasses on! Sooo comfortable. The only thing is that I can feel the band on top of my head a little bit.Design: 5/5, I love that the ear-pads rotate AND fold, and of course the band is adjustable. The buttons have indentations so it’s easy to feel for which button without looking (although it is designed for right-handed users).Functionality: 4/5, works as intended. The play/pause option is a bit slow, like it takes a second for the song to start up again after pressing play. I love that I have the aux cord option as well as the double device bluetooth pairing! Also super appreciate the ANC AND transparent options, so I can choose when I want noise cancellation and when I want to be able to hear my environment. The noise cancellation isn’t total when there’s nothing playing — I can still hear some murmurs from the environment — but it’s not noticeable at all when music is playing.","Reviewed in the United States May 1, 2024",AHNMKS5EITL2LN4E6ZJFQKF3BEXQ,TRUE,0,Color: Black

The sound is very good although it depends what device you connect them to. I've experienced both noise canceling and regular mode and there is very much a difference. The noise canceling can work really well for the most part I could have got hit by a car accidently because I was so engrossed in my music (Not the fault of the headphones) But they are seriously that good since I encounter situations where I rather not converse with so they kind of help me drown out the noise. They work much better as Bluetooth than wired since you can actually change the modes. But the best thing is probably the audio quality because one time i turned the headphones up so loud and the sound was blaring out the headset you would have thought it was a speaker from how loud it was.

R25QM4URY4AMFX,B0BKPRTRXK,4.0 out of 5 stars High quality but with a defect,R. P.,4,"I am impressed by the smooth and high-end physical experience of the articulated joints and comfortable ear pads. The interface buttons are simple and ergonomic and distinct (quick to learn) and the input and charge ports are recessed but can be distinguished by feel in the dark if you want to recharge from bed or switch to jacked-in input in the dark.The Noise cancelling is effective. It is the most effective model for noise cancellation I have had, better than some Bose models.However, the ""transparency mode"" is a disaster. It's essentially a muddy white noise amplifier of every stimulus around. I bought this partly for use while shopping, to discourage interruptions but also wanted to hear clearly outside the headset. So that was a fail. It amplifies tiny ambient noises into a torture booth, leaving me reaching immediately for the volume down button or cycling the ANC button. The ANC button cycles through 3 modes: Active noise cancelling (ANC), noise cancelling off, and transparency mode. Since the transparency mode is bad, it's basically a booby trapped on/off switch for the ANC with a 3rd stop that's annoying.It seemed a tight fit for a smaller/average adult head when new but it did loosen up 100% comfortably after about 10 hours of wear and now is comfortable for even our xlarge head adult and adjusts for all. Well-sized & adjustable from teen to adult, any head size or ear size after a bit of real use. Good placement and coverage on the ear is good for noise isolating too. The larger form factor is ideal (sometimes minor brands sold for less seem made for smaller heads). Joints have not failed after several months.The upper levels of sound seemed too loud for safety, so use caution when rocking out. See if you can get by with a lower setting. Even wearing at full volume there is not much bleed-out sound for bystanders to hear.","Reviewed in the United States November 25, 2023",AH5RLIVNKNU5OQ4V7L2O2DAJ27HA,TRUE,8,Color: Blue

The battery life has been awesome so far. I can use them for around a week about 4 hours a day and they still have some life in them. They are a little tight on me, but that is a good think as I use them on trail hikes and light exercise they stay on.The buttons take some getting used to and I still have to remove them and look sometime to make sure I am pressing the right button for the task. ANC is excellent for the price, the transparent mode is useless though so you can either turn on ANC or off, but once you hear transparent mode you will realize it has no purpose other than making the background noise as well as the media your playing both sound awful.So for the price you will pay these are an excellent value.

RF6ANV9DGAG6A,B0BKPRTRXK,4.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable + Affordable!,NM,4,"Pros:+ Affordable! $25-$35 is a steal imo.+ Comfortable! The ear muff parts are soft and the headphone band sits nicely without too much hair denting. I wear glasses and they don't really press into my face.+Good noise cancelling! The difference with these on really shows as someone with sensitivity to sound + frequent migraines.+Decent audio quality. These meet my needs for daily music listening. Not super loud, maybe better for my ear health.+Bluetooth pairing is relatively easy and quick. No struggle whatsoever compared to my Sony WI-XB400's. Haven't had any problems with distance so far either.Cons:- No hard carrying case. Understandable for the price but some similar headphones do come with at least a carrying bag.- Buttons are a bit hard to get used to, especially because they're all behind the right ear and tactically are pretty similar so I accidentally turn on ANC instead of pausing.- Wearing around the neck is uncomfortable as a big person. Maybe it's because they're more rectangular than circular in form but they dig into my neck so I just take them off completely, which is inconvenient.- You should take them off to rest your ears every like 90 minutes or so. Maybe I got larger than avg ears but my ears thank me for the fresh air after a while. Don't see myself wearing them for long periods of time like I initially thought.tldr; if you don't have much money and just need headphones for listening to like spotify or to block out some noise in public, these are probably the best bang for your buck. if youre an audiophile or looking for professional noise cancelling, maybe consider a bigger budget item than these.UPDATE: I have these on while eating and the constant creaking of the headphones (from my jaw movements) drives me kinda crazy. Maybe just a me thing but definitely something to consider. Also they don't always automatically connect to the bluetooth anymore. Sometimes I have to go into settings manually and even when ""connected"" the audio still comes out of my phone instead. Clicking the play button on the headphones works like 30% of the time to fix this.

R17AVKLQM20C8D,B0BKPRTRXK,5.0 out of 5 stars Great distance!,speppers69,5,These are great budget-friendly headphones. Now I'm no audiophile and didn't get these for sound recording or picking out every sound nuance. I got them for listening to podcasts at night while my significant other is trying to sleep...and working around the house and yard while his remote work is going on. These are great for that. I've been using a variety of ear buds but they make my ears itch and I hate the feeling of something inside my ears. I was wearing these to take out the garbage and take something over to my neighbors...and I didn't lose my connection or sound quality 100s of feet from my phone. I walk all around my house and yard and they've been great. They're really comfortable. I've also read some of the reviews of people having issues wearing glasses with them. I wear reading glasses and had both the glasses and headphones on...no problems whatsoever. No pain. No headaches. The longest I've worn them continuously has been about 4-5 hours with no issues. I would definitely buy these again if for some reason my dog decided they tasted good or they dropped off a bridge.,"Reviewed in the United States April 10, 2024",AGDGM3OCJ6SJGSHPRI26CH57OAIA,TRUE,0,Color: Black

R2EC4G9WC3OF1U,B0BKPRTRXK,5.0 out of 5 stars Best Headphones,Gracefire,5,"I replaced wired headphones (Jlab) that began having difficulty staying connected to my laptop. As long as they were connected, they weren't bad, but keeping them connected was becoming a more recurrent problem. My BF has the same headphones and he said he has the same issue keeping his connected to his laptop, also. Neither of us had the headphones for long, maybe a year or two. So, like I do, when an issue happens enough to think ""replace these!"" I started my search on Amazon for something else. The top review by theoryofmind sold me. They arrived quickly (first out of my several item Amazon order), and I couldn't wait to try them. The manual is succinct but helpful, and in several languages. I paired it with my laptop with no issues, and put them on. I was immediately shocked by how much BETTER the noise cancelling was over the Jlab set. Seriously! I could still hear some louder sounds from other inhabitants of the house, but they were largely diminished. Wearing these was like being in a deep cave...I could faintly hear the external sounds, but what I was listening to was much more clear, and the sound quality was great. I'm no audiophile, and I haven't spent the big bucks on those pricier headphones, so I can easily say these are the best headphones I have ever had. I tested out the ANC button, and using that reduces the noise cancellation, but it enables you to hear your surroundings more easily. That is helpful if you have to listen for something, but still want to wear your headphones. A feature that is new to me, now going Bluetooth, is getting up from my laptop and going to the kitchen for a drink without having to take off the headphones! Oh, Nice! I just received them, so I can't speak to the battery life, but the battery already had a charge, so I could wear them right away. I am completely wowed by this set, especially for the reasonable $29.99 price point, and would highly recommend them to anyone. I am delighted with them! They would also make a great gift for someone else! Unless you're more accustomed to the pricier headphones available, I think these are the best you can get at this price.","Reviewed in the United States October 8, 2023",AEKGI37WZ2ZV6FHL6X74WYCZ6GTA,TRUE,26,Color: Black

They’re not as good as those, don’t get it twisted, but for every day use to run errands or traveling on a train, they do an admirable job of limiting outside noise. The sound of the music is pleasing, they work well as Bluetooth receivers, they haven’t failed me once when taking phone calls, and they fit nicely and are adjustable. I’m grateful for the other positive reviews which convinced me to try these. My only complaint is that they don’t come with a case, but I keep them in their original box when not in use. I recommend these if you’d like to move away from earbuds or just want to preserve a more expensive pair.

R1PCYUZNIC4PB9,B0BKPRTRXK,4.0 out of 5 stars Good value for the money.,KayCee,4,"I ordered these headphones to replace my main noise-cancelling headphones. I don't have a large budget right now to purchase electronics, so these were a good price for me. I was able to purchase these headphones for just under $30. I currently live in an apartment that tends to have a lot of very loud background noise, so noise cancelling headphones, as well as white noise, have become a necessity for me.I ordered these headphones on Thursday, and promptly received them on Friday, the next day. They came with all the items that were supposed to be included. I really like that there is a hard shelled case that is included. However, the case is enclosed in a fabric that seems to be kind of irritating/scratchy to the touch. I haven't used the case, yet, but, it may come in handy in the future. One thing that I really like about these headphones is that they are so lightweight. They have a good, solid feel to them, without being bulky or weighty. They are snug, but, not to the point that I have to keep readjusting them to make them fit comfortably. I used them all day Saturday, and I have only experienced maybe slight itchiness inside my right ear. My ears have not gotten irritated, itchy, or overheated, as is the case with a lot of headphones that I have used. I wear glasses and alot of headphones push my frames in to the point of being painful. These headphones do not cause problems or discomfort with my wearing glasses. The one thing that I do not like, is the loud, (to the point of being jarring), voice prompt that lets the user know that the headphones are connected. I have found that I am better off not wearing them when they are connecting or disconnecting, as the voice prompt is so loud. I wish that there was a way to turn that down. They seem to hold a charge, and even when I have charged them, they don't seem to take very long to charge. The noise- cancelling could be a little better, but, they do seem to reduce some of the background noise. Overall, I have enjoyed using these headphones, and am very pleased with this purchase.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2023",AFVP7JJLJZFQC54OOTBXPSTTUPLQ,TRUE,51,Color: Black

They sound good and do a decent job blocking the lawnmower and weedeater sound, to a point I would pull one side off every now and then to make sure the mower still sounded OK and I hadn't hurt it while treating it like a bushhog. I would 10 out of 10 recomend these to anyone needing them.

THESE FIT!!! Not only do they fit but they actually deliver really decent sound quality. Also, the Active Noise Cancellation on these is very effective. I run a large fan in my office/room, on high, for white noise. It sits about 6' away from me and the noise cancellation on these totally eliminates that noise.I should disclose that I use bluetooth headphones for both my computer and my TV. That way I don't bother anyone else in the house and no one gets to listen in on what I'm doing, especially when I'm making video calls or meetings. These work great for that. The noise cancellation removes any extraneous noise and, really cool, I've been able to quit running the fan for the white noise.Anyway, the price can't be beat. The quality is bordering on really good and I've finally found the brand of headphones I'll be keeping around my office. (I currently have about 11 working pairs of bluetooth headphones.
